In this guide, we will walk through the steps to install the necessary Applications and Tools using **MSYS2** (**M**inimal **SYS**tem) on Windows. This will enable you to code in C# and C++ with SplashKit.

:::note[Already have SplashKit installed?]
If you have previously installed SplashKit:

- Update SplashKit using your MSYS2/MINGW64 terminal with the command: `skm update`
- Then you can skip to [Install SplashKit Globally](#install-splashkit-globally).

:::

Now, let's get started!

To get SplashKit and other coding tools installed on Windows, using MSYS2, follow the steps outlined below:

## 1. Install MSYS2/MINGW64

</div>
:::

<Steps>

1. Download the installer from the official MSYS2 website: [www.msys2.org](https://www.msys2.org/)

2. To install MSYS2, double-click the downloaded executable file, and follow the on-screen instructions.

    :::caution[Use the default install path]

    Make sure to use the default install path: `C:\msys64`

    *Using other paths may cause issues.*

    :::

3. ### Use the "MINGW64" terminal

    MSYS2 comes with a variety of terminal environments.

    You will need to use the **MINGW64** terminal environment (not MSYS or UCRT), which you can find by searching "mingw64" in the Windows Start menu and selecting the **MSYS2 MINGW64** App.

<Steps>

1. Open the **MINGW64** Terminal using **"Run as Administrator"** and run the following command:

    ```bash
    curl -s "https://programmers.guide/resources/MSYS2_InstallScript.sh" | bash /dev/stdin
    ```

    :::note
    This script may take a while to run (approx. 5-10 mins).
    :::

2. Once the automated script has finished running, close and reopen the Terminal.

3. Run the command `skm` to check SplashKit is installed correctly.

4. Lastly, try opening a "New Terminal" in VS Code (*Terminal* > *New Terminal*).

    :::tip[Add MINGW64 Terminal to Visual Studio Code]
    If you do not see the MSYS2/MINGW64 terminal, go to the [Setup VS Code Terminal](#setup-vs-code-terminal) section to add your MSYS2/MINGW64 Terminal into VS Code.
    :::

5. Then, once you're finished, you can go to the [Using MSYS2](#using-msys2) section for more information about accessing files in your C drive with the MSYS2/MINGW64 terminal.

</Steps>

## Manual Steps

### 2. Install Command Line Tools

To install SplashKit, you will firstly need to install the `git`, `clang`, `gcc` and `gdb` command line tools using the `pacman` package manager.

:::note[Command Line Tools Installation Video:]
<div class="not-content">
  <YouTube id="XxaHFoGdlj0" params="fs=1&modestbranding=1&rel=0"/>
</div>

*The command used in the video above has been altered slightly, but the process is the same.*
:::

<Steps>

1. Copy the following command:

    ```bash
    pacman -S git mingw-w64-x86_64-clang mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-gdb --noconfirm --disable-download-timeout
    ```

2. Paste the command into your **MINGW64** Terminal.

    :::caution[Paste commands into MINGW64 Terminal]
    Unfortunately, you won't be able to use `Ctrl` + `V` to paste.

    Instead, right-click anywhere in the terminal window and then select **Paste**.
    :::

3. Press enter to run the command.

</Steps>

---

### 3. Install SplashKit

SplashKit is a beginner's all-purpose software toolkit that will allow you to create fun and exciting programs more easily, especially for Graphical User Interface (GUI) programs.

:::note[SplashKit Installation Video:]
<div class="not-content">
  <YouTube id="ndP8vrf9oOU" params="fs=1&modestbranding=1&rel=0"/>
</div>
:::

<Steps>

1. Copy and paste the following command into your **MINGW64** terminal to download and run the SplashKit installer:

    ```bash
    bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splashkit/skm/master/install-scripts/skm-install.sh)
    ```

    :::tip[Troubleshooting tip:]
    If you have issues installing the SplashKit SDK, go to [this troubleshooting page](https://splashkit.io/troubleshoot/windows-msys2/issue-1-bash-curl-not-working/) on the SplashKit website for an alternative installation process.
    :::

2. Now, close and reopen your **MINGW64** terminal, and run the following command to install the dependencies needed for SplashKit:

    ```bash
    skm windows install
    ```

3. ### Install SplashKit Globally

    Finally, you will need to install the SplashKit Global Libraries. This will install the SplashKit libraries and library include files into the system's default global locations so that the compiler can find these files when building (compiling) programs created with SplashKit.

    To install SplashKit globally, open the **MINGW64** terminal and run the following command in the terminal window:

    ```bash
    skm global install
    ```

    You may need to open the **MINGW64** Terminal with "Run as administrator" if you have issues.

</Steps>

---

### 4. Install Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code, also commonly known as *VS Code* or just *Code*, is a powerful and versatile code editor that enables efficient coding, debugging, and collaboration for your SplashKit projects!

:::note[VS Code Installation Video:]
<div class="not-content">
  <YouTube id="UqGIPYWprRE" params="fs=1&modestbranding=1&rel=0"/>
</div>
:::

:::note[VS Code has it all!]
Once you have your code project set up, Visual Studio Code will be the main program you will use to write, build, run and debug your code.
:::

<Steps>

1. Download and run the installer from: [code.visualstudio.com/Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

    :::tip[Open VS Code from MINGW64 Terminal]
    You can open Visual Studio Code from the **MINGW64** terminal by typing `code` and pressing enter. `code .` will open the current folder in Visual Studio Code.

    *You will need to close and reopen any currently open terminal windows after installing VS Code for the above commands to work.*
    :::

2. ### Setup VS Code Terminal

    Visual Studio Code has a built-in Terminal that you can use instead of needing to switch back and forth between VS Code and your **MINGW64** terminal window. You will need to update some settings to get this working with your **MINGW64** terminal.

3. Open Visual Studio Code, then press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` to open the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette).

4. Start typing "Open user..." and then select **Open User Settings (JSON)** (shown in the orange box in the image below):

    ![Image showing Command palette use to open User Setting (JSON) in VS Code window](./images/setup-windows/vscode-open-user-settings-json.png)
    <div class="caption">Image not subject to The Programmer's Field Guide <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/">CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 License</a></div>

    This will open the **settings.json** file that you can now edit.

5. Create a new line just before the last closing curly brace `}` at the end of the file, and then copy and paste the text below into that line:

    ```json
        "terminal.integrated.profiles.windows": {
            "PowerShell": {
                "source": "PowerShell",
                "icon": "terminal-powershell"
            },
            "Command Prompt": {
                "path": [
                    "${env:windir}\\Sysnative\\cmd.exe",
                    "${env:windir}\\System32\\cmd.exe"
                ],
                "args": [],
                "icon": "terminal-cmd"
            },
            "MSYS2": {
                "path": "C:\\msys64\\usr\\bin\\bash.exe",
                "args": [
                    "--login",
                    "-i"
                ],
                "env": {
                    "MSYSTEM": "MINGW64",
                    "CHERE_INVOKING": "1"
                }
            }
        },
        "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.windows": "MSYS2",
        "terminal.integrated.env.windows": {
            "MSYSTEM": "MINGW64",
            "CHERE_INVOKING": "1"
        },
        "C_Cpp.default.systemIncludePath": [
            "C:\\msys64\\mingw64\\bin",
            "C:\\msys64\\mingw64\\include",
            "${default}"
        ],
        "files.autoSave": "afterDelay",
        "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    ```

    :::note[Troubleshooting Notes:]

    - If you already have some settings included in this file, you will need to add a comma `,` after the closing curly brace `}` on the line above your new line.
    - If you already see code that looks similar to the code above, you may need to copy only small parts to match the code above.
    - The last line of the code above will set your default profile, so that it will automatically use the MSYS2 (MINGW64) terminal. You can also read this [article](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/profiles) to see other ways to set the default terminal.

    :::

6. Save the file for these changes to take effect.

7. Now you can open a new Terminal in VS Code with: ***Terminal* > *New Terminal*** (as shown below):

8. ### Install VS Code Extensions

    The final step to complete the setup of VS Code is to install a few *Extensions* in VS Code:

    [**Set up my VS Code Extensions**](/book/appendix/0-installation/2-7-setup-vscode)

    Go to the page linked above, follow the steps to install both the C# and C/C++ recommended extensions, and then come back here and continue to the next step. *You can use the "Back button" in your browser to return to this page.*

</Steps>

### 5. Install Language Specific Tools

Some coding languages require specific tools/frameworks to be installed to be able to build and run your code files.  
As you will be coding in C# and C++ in this book, let's look at the tools needed for these languages:

### C# Tools

For coding in C#, you will need to install the `.NET` SDK which will allow you to use the *dotnet* terminal command to create, build, and run your C# project code.

:::note[.NET Installation Video:]
<div class="not-content">
  <YouTube id="lmJjNbPwAlw" params="fs=1&modestbranding=1&rel=0"/>
</div>
:::

<Steps>

1. Download the latest version of the .NET SDK (currently .NET 9) for macOS from the official .NET website: [dotnet.microsoft.com/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

2. Run the downloaded installer and follow on-screen instructions.

</Steps>

### C/C++ Tools

For coding in C++, you will need to have a C++ compiler installed to build your C++ code into a file you can use to run your program. Commonly used C++ compilers are `g++` and `clang++`, which can be installed with **GCC** (**G**NU **C**ompiler **C**ollection). You will also need to install **GDB** (**G**NU **D**e**b**ugger), which you can use when debugging C++ programs.

:::note
If you installed the Command Line Tools successfully in Step 2, then you will already have the necessary compilers installed and ready for coding in C++!
:::

Your Windows machine is now set up with MSYS2, Visual Studio Code, and SplashKit, ready for C# and C++ development. Happy coding!

## Using MSYS2

MSYS installs a minimal Linux environment on top of Windows. This will give you easy access to all of your Windows files and folder. The one challenge is that MSYS2 has its own home folder that does not map to your Windows home folder.

If you want to access your Windows home folder you will need to use the `cd` command to move into that folder. Each of your system drives (C: for example) is mapped to a folder with the drive name in the root of the file system. So `C:` is `/c/` in MSYS. To access my Windows Documents folder, I can use the path `/c/Users/andrew/Documents`. You will need to change `andrew` to be your username, so the path will be in the format `/c/Users/<username>/Documents`. The following commands move to my Documents folder.

```bash
# Move to my C drive
cd /c/

# Move to my Documents folder
cd /c/Users/andrew/Documents
```

### File Explorer

Using these commands you should be able to save your projects in a `Code` folder inside your Windows Documents folder for easy access.

You can also use the `explorer.exe` program to open a folder in the File Explorer.

```bash
# Move into my Documents folder
cd /c/Users/`whoami`/Documents

# Open the current directory in File Explorer
explorer .
```

:::note[Shortcut/Alternative way to use "cd" command:]

Here is a video showing how you can click and drag folders into your MSYS2/MINGW64 terminal to make using the `cd` command quicker/easier.

Note that you need to type `cd` then add a *space* before you drag the folder.
