title: Advanced Commands
---

The following concepts are really useful, but will be things that you can come back to at a later stage. If you have time and are feeling confident with this chapter then make the time to read over these now. These concepts and commands can help you understand how things work, and help you understand and resolve issues as they arise.

If this is all very new for you, then you can skip over these and come back to them at a later time. You do not need these concepts and tools right now.
