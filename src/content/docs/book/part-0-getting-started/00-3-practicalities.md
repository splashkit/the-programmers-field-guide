Here are some answers to practical questions you might have.

## What do I need?

### A Computer

Programming is a practical skill that requires time and effort to be mastered. In order to practice, you will need access to a computer and a set of programming tools. The tasks and activities in the Programmer’s Field Guide are designed to work on a range of computers, using free and open source tools.

You don't need anything super expensive to learn the basics of programming. Everything we do here works perfectly well on a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org). With a PI, some components, and a Maker space, you could even put together something of your own.

### Others to learn with

Another good thing to have is company. While you can travel this journey solo, it is usually better with friends. An ideal travel group would include an experienced guide and some companions who are also taking the trip for the first time. If you are at school or university, this will be your tutor and fellow students. Your tutor can help you engage with ideas and provide you with feedback on activities as you go. Your fellow students can help you learn by discussing ideas together and sharing the successes and challenges you encounter along the way.

If you are not already doing this with others, you should consider finding a study group to join. Learning to program can be challenging, so having others to help guide and support you can make a big difference.

Each chapter will provide you with individual and group activities. Engage in these activities with your travel companions, and discuss your understanding of the different tools and sights as we go.

## What language will I learn?

There is often a fixation on which language you will use when learning to **program**. Should we pick this language or another? What should inform the choice of language?

This book focuses on building your mental model and helping you learn how to program. The focus is not on a particular language, but on things that are common across many languages. What you will learn is *more* than just a programming language. By the end of your journey, you will be capable of quickly picking up and using many programming languages.

However, the examples and activities in this book will use a specific language. This will give you the chance to practice what you are learning and help you build a strong mental model. Where we can, we'll also show you how each concept exists or is different in other languages.

### *So which language will I use?*

Throughout the book we use C/C++. This will ensure you are using an appropriate language when learning the core concepts. While the guide uses C/C++ to demonstrate programming concepts, it will not explore the specifics of the language in depth. It will not focus on, or examine, things that are *not* common elsewhere. This means that you will need further study and practice after finishing this book to say that you have "learnt" C/C++.

Most modern systems are built using multiple programming languages, because different languages are better at different things. There is no one best language, so our approach aims to show you the common features across languages and set you up to quickly pick up the language that best fits your needs.

Our goal is that, after finishing this book, you will have all the skills and understanding you need to learn C/C++, and many other programming languages using resources available online and through interacting with things like generative artificial intelligence.

### *What kinds of programs will I create?*

This journey should be fun. While reading and writing text from the terminal can demonstrate all the programming features, it can be a bit boring. Creating visual and interactive programs will help you **see** that your programs are working as you expected.

To help you achieve this, we created the [SplashKit](https://splashkit.io) library. This library is designed to support your journey as you learn to program. It does not take any control away from you but empowers you to make interactive, multimedia programs. It is also designed to utilise common programming features and patterns, enabling you to focus on the fundamentals.

#### Why Games?

Programming is about getting the computer to do what you want it to do. This will involve calculations and data manipulation. For many programs, these values are what is important. For example, we want to calculate values for our bank account balance in a banking application, or record marks for a grading system. When things go wrong it requires you to be able to see what the expected value was, and then think through these calculations to see what happened.

With games, we make it much easier to **see** problems. You still need to go back through the code and understand why, but you can **see** that it is wrong. The player is in the wrong location. They didn't pick up the item when they should have, or they did when they shouldn't have. This **visual** aspect *should* help you engage with your program. You will be drawing your digital reality to the screen, which helps you connect with these abstractions in your code.

The programming knowledge and coding skills you gain by building these games will directly apply to building any other kind of program. So we encourage you to build some games and have some fun while you are learning.

Don't worry if you are not interested, or able, to engage with these visuals. We provide examples and projects that do not require you to use these ideas.

Now that we have this part of the journey mapped out, let's get going.
