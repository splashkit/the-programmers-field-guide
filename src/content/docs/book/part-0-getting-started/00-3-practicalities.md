Here are some answers to practical questions you have.

## What do I need?

### A Computer

Programming is a practical skill that requires time and effort to be mastered. In order to practice, you will need access to a computer and a set of programming tools. The tasks and activities in the Programmer’s Field Guide are designed to work on a range of computers, using free and open source tools.

Don't have a computer - you don't need anything super expensive to learn the basics of programming. Everything we do here works perfectly well on a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org). With a PI, come components, and a Maker space, you could even put together something of your own.

### Others to learn with

Another good thing to have is company. While you can travel this journey solo, learning on your own, it is usually better with friends. An ideal travel group would include an experienced guide and some companions who are also taking the trip for the first time. If you are at school or university, this will be your tutor and fellow students. Your tutor can help you engage with ideas and provide you with feedback on activities as you go. Your fellow students can help you learn by discussing ideas together and sharing the successes and challenges you encounter along the way.

If you are not already doing this with others, you should consider finding a study group to join. Learning to program can be challenging, so having others to help guide and support you can make a big difference.

Each chapter will provide you with individual and group activities. Engage in these activities with your travel companions, and discuss your understanding of the different tools and sights as we go.

## What language will I learn?

There is often a fixation on which language you will use when learning to program. Should we pick this language or another? What should inform the choice of language?

This book focuses on building your mental model and helping you learn how to program. The focus is not on a particular language, but on things that are common across many languages. What you will learn is *more* than just a programming language. By the end of your journey, you will be capable of quickly picking up and using many programming languages.

However, the examples and activities in this book will use a specific language. This will give you the chance to practice what you are learning and help you build a strong mental model. Each chapter will also contain a section that shows you how each concept exists or is different in other languages.

### *So which language will I use?*

The book starts with C/C++ in Part 1 and Part 2, then switches to C# for Part 3. This will ensure you are using an appropriate language when learning each concept. Mixing the two will give us an easier journey, while still allowing us to explore all the necessary paths. The good thing is, both languages have a common syntax, known as "C-style", meaning the transition shouldn’t be too challenging.

While the guide uses these languages to demonstrate programming concepts, it will not explore either one in depth. It will not focus on or examine things that are *not* common elsewhere. This means that you will need further study and practice after finishing this book to say that you have *learnt* C# or C/C++ in detail. But the great thing is that after finishing this book you will have all the skills and understanding you need to learn C#, C/C++, and many other languages using resources available online and through things like generative artificial intelligence.

Most modern systems are built using multiple programming languages, because different languages are better at different things. There is no one best language, so our approach aims to show you the common features across languages and set you up to quickly pick up the language that best fits your needs. This is something we draw upon in Part 4, where we will use different programming languages to build a variety of real-world programs.

Now that we have this part of the journey mapped out, let's get going.
