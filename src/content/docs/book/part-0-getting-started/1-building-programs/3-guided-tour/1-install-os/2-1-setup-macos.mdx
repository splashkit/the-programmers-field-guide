In this guide, we will walk through the steps to install the necessary applications and tools on your Mac.

Now, let's get started!

## 3. Install XCode Command Line Tools

The **Xcode Command Line Tools** are a package of tools provided by Apple for developers to enable command-line development and building of software on macOS. It includes tools you will need for installing SplashKit and coding in the next chapters.

To install these tools, run the command below in your *Terminal* app:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

If you get the following message, it means you've already installed Xcode and are ready to move to the next step!

If not, the following video shows what the installation process should look like.

## 4. Install SplashKit

:::danger[Script asking for your password?]

Before running any script make sure to review its contents to understand what it does. If you choose not to inspect the script, it should only be because you fully trust the source. Running unverified code with elevated privileges can pose serious security risks.

:::

Copy and paste the following command into your terminal window to download and run the SplashKit installer:

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splashkit/skm/master/install-scripts/skm-install.sh)
```

The installation process should look like this:

<div class="not-content">
  <YouTube id="KlT_PCoc0pw" params="fs=1&modestbranding=1&rel=0"/>
</div>

:::tip[Troubleshooting]
1. If the command above **does nothing**, go to [this troubleshooting page](https://splashkit.io/troubleshoot/macos/issue-1-bash-curl-not-working/) on the SplashKit website for an alternative installation process.
2. If you see a message about "**permission denied**" or "**Operation not permitted**", go to the [Permission issue when running SplashKit installation command](https://splashkit.io/troubleshoot/macos/issue-2-zshrc-permission-issues/) page on the SplashKit website for steps to follow to resolve this issue.

## 5. Reopen the Terminal

Once the script has finished running, close and reopen the terminal.

Run the command `skm` in the new terminal to check SplashKit is installed correctly.

## 6. All done!

Everything should now be installed, you are all good to go!
