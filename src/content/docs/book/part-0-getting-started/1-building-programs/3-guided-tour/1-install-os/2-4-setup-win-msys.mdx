In this guide, we will walk through the steps to install the necessary applications and tools using **MSYS2** (a **M**inimal Unix **SYS**tem) on Windows.

Now, let's get started!

## 1. Install MSYS2/MINGW64

<Steps>

  1. Download the installer from the official MSYS2 website: [www.msys2.org](https://www.msys2.org/)

  2. To install MSYS2, double-click the downloaded executable file, and follow the on-screen instructions.

      :::caution[Use the default install path]
      Make sure to use the default install path: `C:\msys64`

      Using other paths may cause issues.
      :::

</Steps>

## 2. Open a MINGW64 (or CLANGARM64) Terminal

<Steps>

3. MSYS2 comes with a number of terminal environments.
   We want to use a specific one. To do this, open the Windows start menu, and search for "MINGW64" (or "CLANGARM64" if using a Windows ARM computer).

    :::note[Look for the blue icon]
    Not sure if you have the right one?

    - The MINGW64 Terminal has a blue icon.
    - The CLANGARM64 Terminal has a green icon.

    :::

4. Open the **MSYS2 MINGW64** (or **MSYS2 CLANGARM64**) Terminal using **"Run as Administrator"**.

</Steps>

The following video shows how to install and open MSYS2 and the MINGW64 terminal.

## 3. Run Automated Setup

<Steps>

5.  In the MINGW64 Terminal, run the following command:

    ```bash
    curl -s "https://programmers.guide/resources/MSYS2_InstallScript.sh" | bash /dev/stdin
    ```

    :::note
    This script may take a while to run (approx. 5-10 mins).
    :::

6. Once the automated script has finished running, close the MINGW64 Terminal.
7. Open a new MINGW64 Terminal.
8. Run the command `skm` to check SplashKit is installed correctly.

</Steps>

## 4. All done!

Everything should now be installed, you are all good to go!

:::caution[Had problems?]

If you had problems with the automated installation, or want to do things yourself, you can follow the [manual install instructions](/book/appendix/0-manual-installation/2-5-setup-win-msys).
