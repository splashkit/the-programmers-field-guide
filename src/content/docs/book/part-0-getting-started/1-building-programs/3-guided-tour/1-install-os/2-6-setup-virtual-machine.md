## 1. Download Virtual Machine Software

There are many VM software options available. We recommend VirtualBox, but you can use any VM software that supports hosting the [Debian](https://www.debian.org/distrib/) Linux distribution.

### VirtualBox (cross-platform)

[Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) is an open-source, cross-platform virtualisation software package for use on Intel or AMD-based computers running Windows, macOS, Linux, or Oracle Solaris, and is free to download.

You can download it from the VirtualBox Downloads site [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

## 2. Setup VM with Debian

There are lots of guides available online for how to set up Debian in your chosen VM software. Here are some suggested links:
