There are several tools that you need to have installed on your computer, so you can build and run the programs we will explore in this guide. These include:

- **Visual Studio Code**, also commonly known as *VS Code* or just *Code*, is a powerful and versatile code editor that enables efficient coding, debugging, and collaboration for your SplashKit projects!
- [SplashKit](https://splashkit.io) is a beginner's all-purpose software toolkit that will allow you to create fun and exciting programs more easily, especially for Graphical User Interface (GUI) programs.
- Compilers to convert your source code into programs you can run.

Different operating systems have different installation steps.
