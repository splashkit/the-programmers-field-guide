Given the computer is unintelligent, how do you give it instructions? Explore the idea of machine code, and the steps the compiler performs.

Watch the video to:

- Get insights into the code a computer runs (machine code).
- See the compiler converts source code to machine code.
- Understand the role of the linker, and how you access libraries.

Understanding the role of the compiler will help you understand issues as they arise.
