Let's step back and think a little about what we are programming. What is the computer capable of?

Watch the video to:

- Explore components of the computer and see what they do.
- Understand that it is the software you create that makes the computer look capable.

Always remember, the computer is unintelligent. This will help you understand everything you need to do to get the computer to do what you want.
