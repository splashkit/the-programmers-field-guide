In this guide, we will walk through the steps to install the necessary Applications and Tools on **WSL** (**W**indows **S**ubsystem for **L**inux) *with Ubuntu*.

Now, let's get started!

To set up WSL and install SplashKit and other coding tools on Windows, follow the steps outlined below:

## 1. Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a feature of Windows that allows you to run a Linux environment on your Windows machine, without the need for a separate virtual machine or dual booting.

:::note[WSL 1 vs WSL 2]
*WSL 2 (recommended) is the default version, but you can look at [this article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual) if you have issues, or if you are using an older Windows 10 version.*
:::

<Steps>
1. Open the Microsoft Store app.
2. [Click this link](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/9P9TQF7MRM4R) or search for **WSL** in the Microsoft Store app (as shown below).
3. Install WSL.

4. [Click this link](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/9PDXGNCFSCZV) or search the Microsoft Store for **Ubuntu**.
5. Install Ubuntu.
</Steps>

## 2. Create Ubuntu User Account

**Restart** your computer if you haven't done so already.

<Steps>
6. A terminal window installing Ubuntu should pop up automatically, otherwise open the WSL or Ubuntu app for this window to open.

7. When prompted, enter your new UNIX username and password.  
   For example, with the username "**default-user**", your terminal would look like this:

   <div class="caption">Image not subject to The Programmer's Field Guide <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/">CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 License</a></div>
   
   You can see in the image above where the "**default-user**" username was first entered (shown in the pink box), and the same username being used with the terminal prompt (shown in the orange box).

   :::tip[Troubleshooting tip:]
   If you have issues installing the WSL with Ubuntu, go to the [Issues creating Ubuntu user account](https://splashkit.io/troubleshoot/windows-wsl/issue-1-user-account-issues/) page on the SplashKit website for a way to reset the Ubuntu installation and user account setup.
   :::
</Steps>

WSL is now setup and ready to use!

:::note[Opening WSL Terminal]
To open a terminal for your WSL, search for "Ubuntu", and click the Ubuntu App (green box below):

:::

## 3. Run Automated Setup

:::caution[Script asking for your password?]

Before running any script that uses **sudo**, make sure to review its contents to understand what it does. If you choose not to inspect the script, it should only be because you fully trust the source. Running unverified code with elevated privileges can pose serious security risks.

:::

<Steps>
8. Open the **Ubuntu** Terminal.
9. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   curl -s "https://programmers.guide/resources/WSL_InstallScript.sh" | bash /dev/stdin
   ```

   :::note
    This script may take a while to run (approx. 5-10 mins).

    If `curl` is not already pre-installed on your WSL environment, you can run the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install curl
    ```
  
    Then run the `curl -s "..." | bash /dev/stdin` command again.
   :::

</Steps>

## 4. Reopen the Terminal

Once the automated script has finished running, close and reopen the Terminal.

Run the command `skm` to check SplashKit is installed correctly.

:::tip[Using WSL Terminal]
Once you're finished, you can go to the [Using WSL](#using-wsl) section for more information about accessing files in your C drive with the WSL terminal.
:::

## 5. All done!

Everything should now be installed, you are all good to go!

:::tip[What next?]
Jump to the [next step](/book/part-0-getting-started/1-building-programs/3-intro-tour/2-code), where we will use these tools to build and run some programs.
:::

:::caution[Had problems?]

If you had problems with the automated installation, or want to do things yourself, you can follow the [manual install instructions](/book/appendix/0-installation/2-0-setup-linux).
