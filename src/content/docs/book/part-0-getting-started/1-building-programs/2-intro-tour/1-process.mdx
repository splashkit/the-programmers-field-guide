Programming is an iterative process, where we grow the program a little at a time. In this video we walk through the process of iterating a program.

Watch the video to see how to:

- Write, edit, compile, and run code.
- Use shortcuts within the Terminal.
- Check for common issues.

When you have worked through this, you will have the practical components for building and running programs.
