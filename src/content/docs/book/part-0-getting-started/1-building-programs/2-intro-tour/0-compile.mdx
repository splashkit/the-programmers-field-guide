In this video we walk through the steps needed to build and run a program. These steps are further elaborated in the [guided tour](/book/part-0-getting-started/1-building-programs/3-guided-tour/0-overview).

Watch the video to see how to:

- Use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to set up a project and write code.
- Run the `clang++` compiler from the Terminal in VS Code.
- Run the program that you created.

Here is the code used in this video, so you can follow along:

    ```cpp
    #include "splashkit.h"

    int main()
    {
        write_line("Hello World");
    }
    ```
