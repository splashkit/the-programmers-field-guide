title: Abstracting further?
---

*Can we abstract things further?*

Programming languages havenâ€™t yet evolved to higher levels of abstraction. Instead, **we** create our own abstractions within them. To communicate our abstractions we can use visual representations such as flow charts, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, and other visual notations. Don't worry if you have no idea what any of those things are yet! We'll introduce them at points where they will be helpful.

So, now it comes to you. The tools you will learn on your journey make it possible to construct whatever digital reality you want with the computer. As you learn the tools of programming and use them to build software, you are creating the next levels of abstraction.
