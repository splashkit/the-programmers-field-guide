For this activity, try to get together into a group of 3-4 people. The idea here is to try and fill in each other's knowledge gaps regarding something that frequently gets overlooked - the **compile command**.
```sh title="For example..."
clang++ hello-world.cpp -o hello -l SplashKit -Wall
```
Things to consider before the activity:
 - Have you really thought about what each section does? What does `-o` mean?
 - Could you write it from scratch?
 - Could there be other useful things you could _add_ to it?

You may have to do some extra Googling to figure this out - work together and solidify your understanding! :)

# Group Activity

## Here's your unique random compile command!
<Code title="Note: It'll change when reloaded!" code={compile_command} lang="sh" />

<Steps>
1. Gather around one of your group members' computers, and read over the compile command above.
2. ##### Discuss the following with each other:
   1. _What_ is being compiled?
   2. _Which_ libraries are being used? (Feel free to search up their names if you're interested in what they are!)
   3. _What_ will the resulting executable be called?
   4. Are there are pieces here we haven't learned about yet? What do they do?
3. ##### Test Yourselves! (Or perhaps "Call over a Tutor!"?)
</Steps>
