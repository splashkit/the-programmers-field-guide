### Add 'code' command to PATH

You can install the `code` command to allow you to open any file or folder in a new Visual Studio Code window, right from your Terminal!

1. Launch VS Code
2. Open the Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P). Type 'shell command', select the "Shell Command: install 'code' command in PATH".

:::tip[Troubleshooting tip:]
If you are having issues with the `code` command not working after following the steps above, go to the ['zsh: command not found: code'](https://splashkit.io/troubleshoot/macos/issue-4-code-not-found/) page on the SplashKit website for to use an alternative installation process.

### Install Extensions

The final step to complete the setup of VS Code is to install a few *Extensions* in VS Code. Run the following command in your Terminal.

```bash
skm vscode extensions
```
