If you cannot get SplashKit working natively, you can use *Virtual Machine (VM) hypervisor software* to create a local Linux (*Debian*) environment that you can use to code with SplashKit.

:::tip[Want a pre-built Virtual Machine? Use these links]
The following steps get you to create and set up your own Virtual Machine. We recommend that you do that, but we also provide pre-built virtual machines that you can consider using.
