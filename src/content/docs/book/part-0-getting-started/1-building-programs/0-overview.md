This chapter is all about the tools you need to build and run your own programs. It includes details on how to install the tools you need, and how to use them to write code, create programs, and run these programs.

## Approaching the Chapter

- Review the [Concept Inventory](/book/part-0-getting-started/1-building-programs/1-concept-inventory) to see how concepts connect together.
- Work through the [Intro Tour](/book/part-0-getting-started/1-building-programs/3-guided-tour/1-install) to install the tools you need, and see how to use them.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this chapter you want to make sure you are able to:

- Use Visual Studio Code to write program code.
- Launch the Terminal in Visual Studio Code.
- Compile a program in the Terminal.
- Run the program you compiled.

You will now be ready to start exploring programming languages and how we can use them to build our own programs.
