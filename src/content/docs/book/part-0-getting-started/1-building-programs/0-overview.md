This chapter is all about the tools you need to build and run your own programs. It includes details on how to install the tools and how to use them to write and run code.

## Approaching the Chapter

- Walk through the [Intro Tour](/book/part-0-getting-started/1-building-programs/2-intro-tour/0-compile) to see how to build and run programs.
- Install the tools you need, and test these out yourself by following the [Guided Tour](/book/part-0-getting-started/1-building-programs/3-guided-tour/0-overview).
- Try out the [Activities](/book/part-0-getting-started/1-building-programs/4-activities/1-group-activity) to explore the idea with others and to see that you can reproduce these steps yourself!
- Review the [Reference](/book/part-0-getting-started/1-building-programs/5-reference/1-programs) section to go into this more deeply, or to get extra information as needed.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this chapter you want to make sure you are able to:

- Use Visual Studio Code to write program code.
- Launch the Terminal in Visual Studio Code.
- Compile a program in the Terminal.
- Run the program you compiled.

You will then be ready to start exploring programming languages and how we can use them to build our own programs.
