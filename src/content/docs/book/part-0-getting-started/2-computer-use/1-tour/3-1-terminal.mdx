Now we need to get our hands dirty and start playing with the Terminal. This will be a very quick tour, but will help get you started. We will expand on this in the next chapter.

Open the terminal on your computer.

<TabItem label="Windows (MSYS2)">

You will need to have installed MSys2. Use the instructions in the [appendix](/book/appendix/0-installation/2-5-setup-win-msys) if you haven't already installed the tools you need.

To open the **MINGW64** terminal (not MSYS2, UCRT64, etc), search "mingw64" in the Windows Start menu and then select the **MSYS2 MINGW64** App (green box below):

To open a WSL Terminal, search "Ubuntu" in the Windows Start menu, and then select the Ubuntu App (green box below):

*You can also follow the steps in the [Configure 'Windows Terminal'](/book/appendix/0-installation/2-6-setup-win-wsl/#configure-windows-terminal) section of the WSL installation page to set up the Windows "Terminal" app to use the WSL terminal.*

:::

At this point, you should see a “prompt” within the terminal. This is the **shell** asking you to give it an instruction. You type commands, and press the Enter or Return key on your keyboard to get the shell to do what you have asked.

Try the following:

```sh
echo "Hello `whoami`"
```

:::caution[Make sure to use backticks]

For these commands to work, make sure you are using double quotes (") around the text and backticks (\`) not single quotes (') around the `whoami`. We will look at why soon.

Now let's have a look at the basic commands you will need to use... these will be enough to get you started and you can learn more as you go.
