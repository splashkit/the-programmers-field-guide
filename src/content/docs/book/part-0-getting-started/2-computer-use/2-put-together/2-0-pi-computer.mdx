Building programs really requires that you have access to a computer that you can play around with. To maximise your experience, we have designed things to work with a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com) single board computer.

![Image of the full Raspberry Pi multi-tool](./images/Pi-Computer/CompeteSetup.jpg)

Using the _Raspberry Pi_ Multi-tool will give you several advantages:

- You can play around with Unix without risking your day-to-day computer (which you can switch to Linux once you are more confident)
- The Raspberry Pi include pins for **General Purpose Input / Output** (**GPIO**) though a [40-pin header](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#gpio-and-the-40-pin-header) on the board:

    ![Raspberry Pi 40-pin header](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/images/GPIO-Pinout-Diagram-2.png)

    We can use this to interact with electronics and see how we can control things in the real world using code.

- Playing with a Raspberry Pi is just more fun 😁.

:::note[Where do you get one of these multi-tools?]
You don't. You _build it yourself_.

The next couple of pages will go over how to build and configure the multi-tool. You can then use it for the activities in the next chapters.
:::

We will first look at the hardware you need, and where you can get it, and then we can look at the software you need and how you can install that using the [Terminal](../../1-concepts/01-terminal) on your Pi.

:::caution[Alternatives to the multi-tool]
Not sure if you want the hardware, but still want to set something like this up? There are some alternatives.

Rather than getting a new physical machine, you can download virtual machine software and follow the software setup to get it working in there.
[Set up my Linux Box](/book/part-0-getting-started/2-computer-use/2-put-together/2-2-setup-linux/)
:::

Let's get going!

## 1. Getting the Hardware

There are many hardware and component choices you can make building your Raspberry Pi multi-tool. Our selection is a self-contained unit using off-the-shelf parts that can run off a battery. Depending on your needs, you may forgo some choices, like the battery or the display.

### Suggested components

## 2. Building your multi-tool

:::tip
Using your own SD card? Make sure you have installed Raspberry Pi OS on it. You can find the instructions in the [Set up my Raspberry Pi](/book/part-0-getting-started/2-computer-use/2-put-together/2-1-setup-pi/) section.
If we have provided you with an SD card, it will already have the OS installed.
:::

Check you have all the components listed above, or equivalent alternatives.

Here is what the components above look like:

![Picture of Raspberry Pi components laid out in their original packaging](./images/Pi-Computer/AllComponets.jpg)

### Prepare the Raspberry Pi board

To help prevent the Raspberry Pi from overheating, it is a good idea to use something called a [**heat sink**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_sink) on the areas that are most likely to get hot when in use.

Locate the Raspberry Pi and 3 piece heatsink kit. Remove the Pi from its packaging.

![Picture of Raspberry Pi and heatsink kit](./images/Pi-Computer/Pi_Heatsink.jpg)

Peel the backing off the heat sinks and stick them to the Pi.

:::note
The largest heatsink goes on the CPU(SOC), the two smaller ones go on the RAM and USB chips (as shown below):

![Picture showing the heat sinks installed on the Pi and Heat Sync Peeled](./images/Pi-Computer/PiHeatsinkPeelInstalled.jpg)

:::

### Secure the Raspberry Pi into the Case

Now we need to put the board inside the case so that we can access the ports, and attach the board to the screen in the next step.  
_Note: You will need a small Phillips Head screwdriver for some steps in this part._

Open the black Raspberry Pi case (and put the screws and feet aside for the moment).

![Picture of the Pi case and screws](./images/Pi-Computer/PiandCase.jpg)

:::tip[Insert the Pi into the case]
This case is a bit fiddly to get the Pi in correctly, but it doesn't require much force.

- Place the Pi in the case
- Align the network port with the opening.
- Apply a little pressure to the back of the USB ports, the headphone jack should slide into place.
- Push the board across so the USB-C power and Mini HDMI ports are seated correctly.
- All 4 Pi screws should line up with the holes in the case.

![Gif showing the Pi installed in the case](/gifs/pi-computer/PiCaseInstall.gif)

:::

To keep the Raspberry Pi from moving around, use the screwdriver to screw the four **short screws** through the yellow circles on the board to secure the Pi to the case:

<MySwiper client:only height="" images={Swiper1}></MySwiper>

### Install the cooling fan on Case Lid

The case we have suggested allows for you to attach a cooling fan. Similar to the heat sinks mentioned above, this will help prevent the board from overheating and running slower.

Peel the plastic protective layer off the lid of the case, and place it on your work space upside down (as shown below). Take the fan out of its packaging, as well as the four included screws.

![Picture of the fan and case top](./images/Pi-Computer/CaseTopFan.jpg)

Place the fan on the case mounts with the label facing up and use **two** of the screws to secure it in place using the two mounting holes shown above.

:::note
Facing the label up will ensure the fan blows air into the case.  
Only two screws are required to secure the fan. The other two screws and the four nuts are not required.  
Ensure the fan cable is close to one of the long sides.

![Picture of the fan installed on the case lid](./images/Pi-Computer/FanInstalled.jpg)

:::

To power the cooling fan, you will need to connect the fan to the GPIO pins on the Pi. (See image at top of this document for pin locations)

Put the case lid and secured fan next to the base part of the case, and connect the 3 wires to the following GPIO pins:

- <span style="color:red">_Red_</span> wire to pin 4 (5V)
- _Black_ wire to pin 6 (Ground)
- <span style="color:blue">_Blue_</span> wire to pin 8 (GPIO14)

You should now have something that looks similar to this:

![Picture of the fan connected to the Pi](./images/Pi-Computer/FanConnected.jpg)

Lastly, place the lid on the case, ready for the next step:

![Picture of placing lid onto case](./images/Pi-Computer/CaseLid.png)

### Attach VESA Mount to Case

This next step will allow you to attach your Raspberry Pi's Case to the back of the screen which will allow it to be more portable.

Open the VESA mount packaging and peel the protective layer off the VESA mount (as shown below).  
_Keep the nylon screws/spaces aside for the next part._

![Picture of the case and VESA mount](./images/Pi-Computer/VESAMountUnWrap.png)

Secure the VESA mount to the case using the four **long screws** that were included in the packaging for the Case. This will also keep the case lid securely attached.

![Picture of the VESA mount installed on the case](./images/Pi-Computer/VESAMountScrews.jpg)

:::danger[Important!]

- Make sure to line up mount so that the 75 x 75mm VESA mount holes are on opposite side to the USB-C and Mini HDMI ports.
- It doesn't matter if the mount is flipped (as it is in the image above), as the middle holes won't be used.

:::

### Insert the Micro SD Card

Due to the position of the Micro SD card slot on the Raspberry Pi, it is easier to insert the Micro SD card at this point, while it is more easily accessed.

To insert the Micro SD card into the Raspberry Pi:

- Remove the Micro SD card form the SD card adapter.
- Position the Pi with the VESA mount on top.
- Insert the SD card into the Pi with the label facing up.

<MySwiper client:only height="" images={Swiper2}></MySwiper>

## 3. Connecting the Accessories

To interact with the Raspberry Pi's Operating System, we will need to connect the **Screen**, **Keyboard**, and **Mouse** to the Pi in a _somewhat specific_ way. These steps below will guide you through the correct set up.

### Attach the Display Screen with VESA mount

Take the screen out of its box, and grab the nylon screws/spaces from the VESA mount that we put aside earlier:

![Picture of the screen box and screen](./images/Pi-Computer/ScreenWithBox.jpg)

:::danger[Important!]
Make sure the SD card is inserted before connecting the screen, or you will likely need to remove the screen to insert it.
:::

To attach the Raspberry Pi to the display screen:

- Face the top of the screen towards yourself
- Place two of the spacers on the VESA mount holes on the screen closets to the top.
- Place the Pi on top of the spacers.
- Place the other spaces on the nylon screws
- Secure the Pi to the screen using the two nylon screws and four spacers. You can use your fingers to tighten the screws.

Here are some images to help you follow along:

<MySwiper client:only height="" images={Swiper3}></MySwiper>

Next, locate the **Micro HDMI to HDMI** and **20 cm USB-C to USB-A** cables (as shown below):

![Image of USB-C to USB-A and Micro HDMI to HDMI cables](./images/Pi-Computer/USB-C-HDMI-Cables.jpg)

For the **20 cm USB-C to USB-A** cable:

- Connect the USB-C end to the Screen's "Display & Touch" port.
- Connect the USB-A end to one of the USB-A ports on the end of the Pi.

For the **Micro HDMI to HDMI** cable:

- Connect the Micro HDMI to the Pi's **first** HDMI port (closest to the power USB-C port).
- Connect the full-size HDMI to the Screen's "HDMI" port.

<MySwiper client:only height="" images={Swiper4}></MySwiper>

:::tip[Recommendations]

- Make sure the Micro HDMI is connected to the first port as shown in the images above. Using the second HDMI port may cause sound issues.
- Putting a loop in the cable will help with cable management.

:::

The suggested screen comes with a handy little stand so that you can set it up easily on a table or desk.

Remove the stand from it's packaging and bend into the shape shown in the image below:

![Image of the stand](./images/Pi-Computer/Stand.jpg)

Place the display screen on the stand.

_Note: It can be a challenging to get the screen to sit correctly, so you may need to fiddle with the cables:_

<MySwiper client:only height="" images={Swiper5}></MySwiper>

### Connect the Keyboard and Mouse

To allow you to use the Raspberry Pi and screen in the same way you would use a regular computer/laptop, we need to connect the keyboard and mouse.

Locate your **Raspberry Pi Official Keyboard** and **Raspberry Pi Official Mouse**:

![Image of the keyboard and mouse](./images/Pi-Computer/KeyboardMouse.jpg)

Using the cable in the keyboard box, connect the **micro USB** end to the micro USB port on the keyboard, and the **USB-A** end to one of the black USB-A ports (USB 2.0) on the Pi.

<MySwiper client:only height="" images={Swiper6}></MySwiper>

## 4. Powering the Multi-tool

There are multiple configurations you can use to power the multi-tool.

![Image of the multi-tool with different power options](./images/Pi-Computer/PowerOptions.jpg)

### Using Mains Power

The easiest way to power the multi-tool is to use the power supply that came with the Pi.

**To use mains power:**

- Connect the USB-C end to the Pi's USB-C power port.
- Plug the other end into a power outlet.

:::tip
Fold the screen down to plug in the power supply.
:::

<MySwiper client:only height="" images={Swiper7}></MySwiper>

### Using Battery Power

If you are on the go or want to use the multi-tool in a location without power, you can use a battery/power bank.

**To use battery power:**

- Locate the longer USB-C to USB-A cable.
- Connect the USB-A end to the power bank.
- Connect the USB-C end to the Pi.
- The power bank will turn on automatically.

<MySwiper client:only height="" images={Swiper8}></MySwiper>

:::note
For intense workloads you may need to connect the display directly to the battery bank rather than via the Pi.

This can be done either with the supplied USB-C to USB-C cable or using the 20Cm USB-C to USB-A cable. _(Note that will disable the touch functionality of the screen.)_

Here is the setup using the **USB-C to USB-C cable**:

![Image showing the battery/power bank connected to the screen via USB-C to USB-C](./images/Pi-Computer/Battery_USB-C-USB-C.jpg)

And here is the setup using the **20 cm USB-C to USB-A cable**:

![Image showing the batter/power bank connected to the screen via USB-C to USB-A](./images/Pi-Computer/BatteryUSB-C-USB-A.jpg)

:::

## 5. Finalising the Mutli-tool Setup

Almost done, just a few final touches!

### Tidying up

To make the cables a bit neater, you can use the cable ties from the packaging to secure the cables together:

![Image of the multi-tool with cable ties](./images/Pi-Computer/CableTies.jpg)

### Complete Setup

You should now have a fully constructed Raspberry Pi multi-tool.

![Image of the full Raspberry Pi multi-tool](./images/Pi-Computer/CompeteSetup.jpg)

To continue the setup process, continue to the next page: [Set up my Raspberry Pi](/book/part-0-getting-started/2-computer-use/2-put-together/2-1-setup-pi/) for instructions on how to install the operating system and configure the Pi.
