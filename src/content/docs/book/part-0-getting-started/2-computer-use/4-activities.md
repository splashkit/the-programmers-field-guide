You will build a number of programs and small projects as you progress through the journey in this book. To help yourself, we recommend organising your file system in a way that will make it easy to find these projects from the terminal.

Think about how you will organise your projects, and where on your computer's file system you will store them.
Then, practice using the terminal commands to interact with your computer through the shell.

Explore the files in your file system. Using `cd`, `ls`, and `cat` you can move between folders, list the files there, and output the contents (using `cat`).

:::tip[Get adventurous!]
Try using [grep](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/grep.1.html) with cat to search files for a given pattern. You can use this with `cat` by piping the output of cat into grep. The following example would search the todo.txt file for the word "urgent".

```bash
cat todo.txt | grep urgent
```
