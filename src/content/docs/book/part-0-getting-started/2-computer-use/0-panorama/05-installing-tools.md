title: Installing Tools
---

Learning to program will require you to put into practice the things you are reading. To do this, you need to install a few things.

- **Code Editor** - in which you will write your code.
- **Compiler** - used to convert your code into machine code.
- **Libraries** - packages of existing code you can build on top of.

Jump over to the [installation guides](/book/appendix/0-installation/0-overview) to install the tools you need. These guides will step you through installing these tools on your computer. You will get to use these in the next chapter.
