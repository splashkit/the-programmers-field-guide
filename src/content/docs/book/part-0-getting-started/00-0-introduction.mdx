## Welcome to the Programmer's Field Guide

Wherever you look, computers and software are driving the world. Your ability to understand and shape how these computers operate will ensure that you can make the most of these tools, and connect with the growing field of computing.

Learning to program will give you a good understanding of how computers, and the skills and understanding you develop here will set you up to work with others (human and AI).

The Programmer's Field Guide maps your journey through the concepts, tools, and processes you need to master to truly take advantage of the power of computing.
