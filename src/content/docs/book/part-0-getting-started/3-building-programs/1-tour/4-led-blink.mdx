Welcome to our fun, step-by-step guide on how to blink a physical LED using SplashKit on your Raspberry Pi! In this tutorial, you'll learn how to set up your hardware, write simple code (without loops) to turn your LED on and off with delays, as well as how to run your project. Get ready to see your LED come to life!

## Hardware Setup

### Components

To build the simple LED circuit shown below (in real life), here's what you need:

- **LED:** Can be any color.  
  *Remember: the longer leg is the anode (+), the shorter is the cathode (-).*
- **220 Ω Resistor:** This protects the LED by limiting the current.
- **Breadboard and Jumper Wires:** For making temporary connections.
- **Raspberry Pi:** With a GPIO pin (we'll use GPIO Pin 11) and a Ground (GND) pin.

### Wiring Instructions

![Led Blink Circuit](./images/blinkledcircuit.png)

<Steps>

1. **Put the LED and resistor onto the breadboard:**

    Place the resistor across the center channel of the breadboard, or across any two separate rows.

    Then place the LED across two rows (as shown above), with the cathode (short leg) on the same row as one end of the resistor.

2. **Attach the ground wire:**

    Attach a jumper wire from the other end of the resistor to a GND pin.  
    *(This is the black wire connected to pin 6 in the diagram above.)*

3. **Connect the LED to the GPIO Pin:**

    Attach a jumper wire from the LED’s anode (long leg) to GPIO Pin 11.
    *(This is the blue wire connected to pin 11 in the diagram above.)*

</Steps>

:::caution[Safety Note:]
Always double-check your connections and ground yourself before handling the circuit to avoid static discharge or accidental damage!

## Blinking the LED

<Steps>

1. **Initialise the GPIO Pins:**

    First, we'll initialise the GPIO system on the Raspberry Pi using SplashKit and set up our chosen pin as an output.

    ```csharp
    using SplashKitSDK;
    using static SplashKitSDK.SplashKit;

    // Initialise the GPIO system
    RaspiInit();

    // Define the LED pin (using physical Pin 11)
    GpioPin ledPin = GpioPin.Pin11;

    // Set the LED pin to output mode (output mode is represented by 1)
    RaspiSetMode(ledPin, GpioPinMode.GpioOutput);
    ```

2. **Blink the LED:**

    Now, we’ll blink the LED by turning it on and off with delays in between. We’re keeping it simple—no loops here! Each command is written in sequence:

    ```csharp
    // Turn the LED ON
    RaspiWrite(ledPin, GpioPinValue.GpioHigh);
    Delay(500);  // Wait for 500 milliseconds

    // Turn the LED OFF
    RaspiWrite(ledPin, GpioPinValue.GpioLow);
    Delay(500);  // Wait for 500 milliseconds

    // Blink the LED again (ON)
    RaspiWrite(ledPin, GpioPinValue.GpioHigh);
    Delay(500);  // Wait for 500 milliseconds

    // Turn the LED OFF again
    RaspiWrite(ledPin, GpioPinValue.GpioLow);
    Delay(500);  // Wait for 500 milliseconds

    // One more blink (ON)
    RaspiWrite(ledPin, GpioPinValue.GpioHigh);
    Delay(500);  // Wait for 500 milliseconds

    // Finally, turn the LED OFF
    RaspiWrite(ledPin, GpioPinValue.GpioLow);
    Delay(500);  // Wait for 500 milliseconds
    ```

3. **Reset the GPIO system:**

    Lastly, we'll clean up the GPIO system and ensure our pins are turned off.

    ```csharp
    // Clean up the GPIO system
    RaspiCleanup();
    ```

</Steps>

### Full Code Example

Below is the complete code, combining the initialisation, blinking sequence and resetting the system. All commands are executed one after the other—no loops!

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem header="Full LED Blink Code (C#)">
  
  ```csharp
  using SplashKitSDK;
  using static SplashKitSDK.SplashKit;

  // Initialise the GPIO system
  RaspiInit();

  // Define the LED pin (using physical Pin 11)
  GpioPin ledPin = GpioPin.Pin11;

  // Set the LED pin to output mode
  RaspiSetMode(ledPin, GpioPinMode.GpioOutput);

  // Blink 1: Turn LED ON, wait, then OFF
  RaspiWrite(ledPin, GpioPinValue.GpioHigh);
  Delay(500);  // LED ON for 500 ms
  RaspiWrite(ledPin, GpioPinValue.GpioLow);
  Delay(500);  // LED OFF for 500 ms

  // Blink 2: Turn LED ON, wait, then OFF
  RaspiWrite(ledPin, GpioPinValue.GpioHigh);
  Delay(500);
  RaspiWrite(ledPin, GpioPinValue.GpioLow);
  Delay(500);

  // Blink 3: Turn LED ON, wait, then OFF
  RaspiWrite(ledPin, GpioPinValue.GpioHigh);
  Delay(500);
  RaspiWrite(ledPin, GpioPinValue.GpioLow);
  Delay(500);

  // Clean up the GPIO system
  RaspiCleanup();
  ```

### Build and Run

<Steps>

1. **Create a new C# project for the LED blinking program:**

    Open your terminal and create a new C# console project:

    ```shell
    mkdir LedBlink
    cd LedBlink
    dotnet new console
    dotnet add package SplashKit
    code .
    ```

2. **Copy/Paste the example code:**

    Replace the contents of your `Program.cs` file with the full code example above.

3. **Build and run the project:**

    Use the following command to build and run the program:

    ```shell
    dotnet run
    ```

</Steps>

### Expected Outcome

When you run the program, your physical LED connected to GPIO Pin 11 should blink on and off three times. Each "on" state lasts for 500 milliseconds followed by an "off" state for 500 milliseconds. Once the sequence is complete, the program cleans up the GPIO settings and exits.
