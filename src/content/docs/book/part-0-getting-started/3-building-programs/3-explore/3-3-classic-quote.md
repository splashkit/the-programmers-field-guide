Write a tiny terminal application that simply greets the user and prints the opening line of your favourite book

```txt
Welcome to the classic-quote generator!

“It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.”

```

Or, Level‑up by presenting the greeting inside a very simple terminal‑based user interface — think of those chunky boxes you see in retro command‑line tools. Use a classic sci‑fi computer quote for the salutation. Example shown with HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey.

```txt
+--------------------------------------------------+
|                                                  |
|   Good evening, Dave. I’m HAL 9000.              |
|   "I’m sorry, Dave. I’m afraid I can’t do that." |
|                                                  |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

Stick to the commands and concepts we’ve already covered (e.g., WriteLine / print equivalents). Avoid extra prompts or calculations—keep it truly minimal.
