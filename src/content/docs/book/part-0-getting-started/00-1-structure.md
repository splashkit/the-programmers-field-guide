title: Guide Structure
---

The field guide focuses on developing a strong mental model of programming. It takes a bottom-up approach to introducing tools and capabilities so that you can understand how different things build upon each other and interact within the computer.

Initially, you will explore how instructions in the computer work at the lower levels. This will help you understand what is happening as your programs run and how the different parts all work together. When you understand this, you'll be able to explain how your programs work and know how to get new things working in the future.

## The Parts

**Part 0**, which sets the background for the book. In this part, the introduction outlines the approach of the book, and the remaining chapter on [Building Programs](/book/part-0-getting-started/1-building-programs/0-overview) will help you start working with the tools you need to build and run your own programs.

**Part 1** of the book focuses on *programs as instructions*. This part will help you understand how the most basic elements work within the computer. Understanding how these elements work individually will help you see how they are combined to create programs. The programs you make in this section will be relatively small, enabling you to focus on the mechanics and effects of each individual instruction. Your learning from this part will give you a solid foundation upon which to start building larger programs.

**Part 2** builds on the foundation from Part 1, taking it to the next level of abstraction by exploring how you build larger *things* within your programs. We will introduce you to tools for combining elements and packaging instructions and data into entities. The programs you make in this section will start to get a little larger as you build more meaningful entities. However, this part focuses mostly on the *tools* available to organise the code in our programs. What you learn here will help set you up to start thinking about how we decide *which tools* to use and *when*.

**Part 3**, moves away from code to think more about software design. Building upon your understanding of how programs work as instructions, and how to organise the instructions and information, you will learn how you can think about programs as *conceptual models*. With this understanding, you will have the knowledge and skills needed to design and create sophisticated programs.

The toolkit you develop over parts 1 to 3 enable you to create any kind of software. We'll explore this further in **Part 4** by looking at how to use the things you have learnt to build a range of real-world software systems. We will introduce you to some new paths you will be able to travel.
