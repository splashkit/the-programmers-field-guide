Our first trek will explore the central role of sequence in our programs.

At the end of this trek, make sure you can:

- Create small programs that:
  - Contain a sequence of instructions that achieve something.
  - Use the SplashKit library.
  - Call procedures, with a range of arguments.
- Correctly use programming terminology to explain your code.
