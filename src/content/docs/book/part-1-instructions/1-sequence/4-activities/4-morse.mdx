You may also find it useful to read about [audio in SplashKit](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence/5-reference/34-audio) for this task.

Create a program that outputs a word or short message (i.e. at least three characters) using Morse code.

Download a short [dit sound effect](/resources/morse_dit.ogg), and a longer [dah sound effect](/resources/morse_dah.ogg). Play the dit sound for a "dot" or the dah sound for a "dash", using details on [Morse code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code) to arrange these into characters. For example, an "A" is communicated by playing the dit sound effect, and then the dah sound effect. The necessary codes for each character are shown in the image below.

- Make sure to output sounds for at least 3 characters
- Add appropriate delays:
  - for each sound (100ms for dit and 300ms for dah with the files above)
  - between each sound (100ms)
  - and between characters (300ms)

Ensure you can identify and explain:

- Procedure calls
- Arguments
- Expressions
- Literals
- Sequence
