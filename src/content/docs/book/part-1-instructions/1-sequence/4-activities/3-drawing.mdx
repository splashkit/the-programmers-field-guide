<NoCopy>
For this task you can build on the ideas from the [house drawing](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence/3-guided-tour/01-00-house-drawing) tour. You may also find it useful to read about [drawing in SplashKit](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence/5-reference/33-graphics/#drawing-to-a-window).

Create a program that draws a custom picture using shapes and colours from SplashKit.

- Make sure to draw at least 3 shapes
- Use a number of different colours
- Optionally, include images and/or text

Keep your image simple, like a car or a flower. Focus on using sequence to appropriately layer the shapes in your composition.

Make sure that you can identify and explain:

- Procedure calls
- Arguments
- Expressions
- Literals
- Sequence

:::caution
Don't spend too long on this, but with a little time you should be able to draw something interesting.
