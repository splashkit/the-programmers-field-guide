<NoCopy>
For this task you can build on the ideas from the [house drawing](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence/3-guided-tour/01-00-house-drawing) tour. You may also find it useful to read about [drawing in SplashKit](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence/5-reference/33-graphics/#drawing-to-a-window) and [playing sound effects in SplashKit](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence/5-reference/34-audio/) for this task.

Create a program that draws a custom picture using shapes and colors from SplashKit - while sticking with just a single sequence.

- Make sure to draw at least 3 shapes
- Use a number of different colors
- Optionally, include images and/or text

Make it a simple image like a car or flower shape. Focus on sequence - use this to appropriately layer the shapes in your composition.

Make sure that you can identify and explain:

- Procedure calls in your code
- Arguments
- Expressions
- Literals
- Sequence

:::caution

Don't spend too long on this, but with a little time you should be able to draw something interesting or show a few images and maybe play a few sound effects.
