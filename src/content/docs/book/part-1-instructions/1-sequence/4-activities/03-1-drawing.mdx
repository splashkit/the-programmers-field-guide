For this task you can build on the ideas from the [house drawing](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence/3-guided-tour/01-00-house-drawing) tour. You may also find it useful to read about [drawing in SplashKit](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence/5-reference/11-2-graphics/#drawing-to-a-window) and [playing sound effects in SplashKit](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence/5-reference/11-3-audio/) for this task.

Create a program that draws a custom scene, picture, or animation using shapes and colors from SplashKit - while sticking with just a single sequence.

- Make sure to draw at least 3 shapes, or have a few steps in your animation

This could be a simple image like a car or flower shape, or you could combine text, delays, drawing, and sound effects to create an animation.

For example, the following is a starter/trailer for some scary game. Use this for inspiration.

```txt
You are approaching what looks like a haunted house
(delay)
(play door creak sound effect - delay scaled)
It is dark in here...
(delay then print) Spiders everywhere!
(open window - show black - delay)
(draw scary picture - play scream sound effect - short delay)
(draw black screen - short delay)
(draw scary picture again - short delay)
(draw black screen - short delay)
(draw scary picture again - with "game" logo below and the text "coming soon")
```

Hopefully that gives you an idea of what you could do here.

:::caution

Don't spend too long on this, but with a little time you should be able to draw something interesting or show a few images and maybe play a few sound effects.
