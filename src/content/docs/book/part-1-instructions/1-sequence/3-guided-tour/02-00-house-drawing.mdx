As with the chat bot, we want to get started quickly. So kick things off with a new folder and source code file.

1. Open a folder in VS Code, and create a new `.cpp` file.

2. Start by adding the [#include directive](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence/0-panorama/1-method-library) to access the SplashKit library, and an empty [`main` function](TODO).

    <Accordion>
      <AccordionItem header="Initial code">

    At this point you should just have these lines of code.

    ```c++
    #include "splashkit.h"

    int main()
    {
        // Our main code will go here!
        return 0;
    }
    ```

      </AccordionItem>
    </Accordion>
