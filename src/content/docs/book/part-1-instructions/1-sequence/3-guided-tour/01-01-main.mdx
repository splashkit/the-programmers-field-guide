Before we start writing our house drawing instructions, first we need to briefly understand how instructions are organised in C++.

## Where do we start from?

In C++, each program must contain a `main` block of code, which forms the starting point for the program. Have a look at the diagram below - the code within the braces (`{ ... }`) is what runs when the program starts.

- contains a list of instructions.
- runs when the program is started.

## Let's write it

Let's start writing our program by getting `main` set up!

<Steps>
1. Open a folder in VS Code, create a new `.cpp` file, and open it. Refer [here](/book/part-0-getting-started/1-building-programs/3-guided-tour/3-first-project/) if you get stuck.

2. Let's add the [#include directive](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence/5-reference/10-library/#in-c) to access the SplashKit library, and an empty `main`. Below is some code you can use:

    ```cpp
    #include "splashkit.h"

    int main()
    {
        // The code within these braces is run when the program starts
    }
    ```

    We will go into details on how the `main` works in the [next part](/book/part-2-organised-code/1-structuring-code/0-overview).

    We now have an empty program set up, ready for us to add instructions in to.
</Steps>

:::note[What is main?]
In C/C++, `main` is a [function](/book/part-1-instructions/2-data/5-reference/01-function). We look at these further in later chapters. For now, you will just need to enter this code as is, and make sure any instructions you want to run occur between the starting `{` and the `}` that appears at the end.
