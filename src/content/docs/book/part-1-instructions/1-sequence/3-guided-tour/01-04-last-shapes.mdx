Complete the house by adding in the rectangle and triangle. Here are the relevant coordinates:

- Rectangle: use `color_gray()`, draw at 300,300, with a width of 200, and a height of 200.
- Triangle: use `color_red()`, draw with points at 250,300, and 400,150, and 550,300.


<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem header="House drawn">

  ```c++ {9-10}
  #include "splashkit.h"

  int main()
  {
      open_window("House Drawing by Andrew", 800, 600);

      clear_screen(color_white());
      fill_ellipse(color_bright_green(), 0, 400, 800, 400);
      fill_rectangle(color_gray(), 300, 300, 200, 200);
      fill_triangle(color_red(), 250, 300, 400, 150, 550, 300);

      refresh_screen();

      delay(5000);
  }
  ```

  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

Compile and run your program and check that you can see the house.
