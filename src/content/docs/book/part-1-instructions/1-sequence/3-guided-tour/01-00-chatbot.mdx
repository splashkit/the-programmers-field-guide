Let's get started with our first program! We'll begin with a simple terminal program that greets the user and responds back to them. This sounds complex, but we'll be using some basic traditional techniques - it'll be fun :)

## Step 1: Understand what we want

    To build a program you must know what you are trying to create. So what do we want as output from this program? The following is an example of what we are after:

    <NoCopy>
    ```txt
    Welcome to the very basic bot experience!
    Please answer using single words :)
    ----------------------------------------

    Bot: Hello! What's your name?
    > Sean
    Bot: Hi Sean, nice to meet you!
    Bot: What's your favourite TV show?
    > Serial Experiments Lain
    Bot: I don't like Serial Experiments Lain that much sorry.
    Bot: What about food? Favourite meal?
    > Lasagna
    Bot: lasanga is a better choice at least...
    Bot: anyway bye!

    The bot has left the chat.
    ```
    </NoCopy>

    - The bot will always ask the same questions and reply in the same way - we'll just mix in the words the user types to make it _seem_ like it's actually replying.
    - We'll slightly adjust the user's reply at times - for instance we can make the favourite food reply _lowercase_ to make it seem more casual.
    - We'll also add slight _delays_ between each message, to make them seem like they took time to type.

## Step 2: Understand what we need

    So what are the main functions and procedures we need to be able to write this program? Have a think about _what_ the program is doing, and see if you can list four or five things - for instance, "writing text to the terminal". Write them down :)

    <details>
    <summary>Have you noted them down? Let's compare.</summary>
    The main five things we need, are to be able to...
    1. _write_ text to the terminal.
    2. _read_ the user's reply.
    3. _combine_ the user's reply with the pre-written messages
    4. _change_ the user's reply to be lowercase (for the last reply)
    5. _delay_ between each message

    Once we have these five pieces in place, we can combine them together to make our program :)
    </details>

    Now that we know what we need, let's go and have a look at the terminal functions and procedures we can use to achieve this!
