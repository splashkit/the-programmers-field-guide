Now that we have our `main` function ready, let's start making our program output some messages.

<Steps>
1. Let's review the initial messages we want to output:
    ```txt
    Welcome to the very basic bot experience!
    Please answer using single words :)
    ----------------------------------------

    Bot: Hello! What's your name?
    ```

    (feel free to customize the text!).

    Looking back at the [terminal methods](../01-01-terminal/), we have methods to output text (`write` and `write_line`) - one of these will be useful here. Try using that procedure to write out each of these lines.

    <Accordion>
      <AccordionItem header="Writing out the opening messages">

    ```c++ {5-10}
    #include "splashkit.h"

    int main()
    {
        write_line("Welcome to the very basic bot experience!");
        write_line("Please answer using single words :)");
        write_line("----------------------------------------");
        write_line();

        write_line("Bot: Hello! What's your name?");

        return 0;
    }
    ```
    Hopefully it's clear how the code is flowing from top to bottom - each `write_line` prints a line, and each `delay` makes the program pause for a short time before continuing.
      </AccordionItem>
    </Accordion>

    :::tip
    Make sure to compile and run your program at each step! Making small changes each time makes it much easier to fix bugs and develop smoothly.

2. Now let's add a short delay between each line - I'd recommend somewhere between 200-400 milliseconds. Simply insert a new statement that calls the `delay` procedure between each line.

    <Accordion>
      <AccordionItem header="Adding delays">

    ```c++ {7, 9, 12}
    #include "splashkit.h"

    int main()
    {
        write_line("Welcome to the very basic bot experience!");
        write_line("Please answer using single words :)");
        delay(200);
        write_line("----------------------------------------");
        delay(200);
        write_line();

        delay(200);
        write_line("Bot: Hello! What's your name?");

        return 0;
    }
    ```
    Hopefully it's clear how the code is flowing from top to bottom - each `write_line` prints a line, and each `delay` makes the program pause for a short time before continuing.
      </AccordionItem>
    </Accordion>

3. Let's _start_ allowing the user to type. We'll get this working properly on the next page, but for now let's consider how we want it to look and what functions/procedures we can use.
    ```txt
    > User input goes here
    ```

    To accomplish this, we want to write out the `> `, and _then_ call `read_line()`. `read_line()` will allow us to type at the end of the last piece of text written, so this time we _don't_ want to move to the next line. Consider: do we want to use `write_line` still, or is there a better option for this?

    **Note:** We're not _using_ the value that `read_line()` returns yet - we're just calling the function so the user can type something in.

    <Accordion>
      <AccordionItem header="Allowing the user to type">

    ```c++ {14-15}
    #include "splashkit.h"

    int main()
    {
        write_line("Welcome to the very basic bot experience!");
        write_line("Please answer using single words :)");
        delay(200);
        write_line("----------------------------------------");
        delay(200);
        write_line();

        delay(200);
        write_line("Bot: Hello! What's your name?");
        write("> ");
        read_line(); // returned value goes nowhere for now

        return 0;
    }
    ```
      </AccordionItem>
    </Accordion>
</Steps>

Right now we're outputting our messages, and the user is able to type something. Now let's see how we can use what the user typed, to change our responses in a simple way.
