Here's a list of some useful graphical methods SplashKit provides. You'll find these come in handy when going through future tasks, feel free to refer to this page whenever needed.

```c++
// Open a window to draw to
window open_window(string caption, int width, int height);

// Clear the current window to the indicated color
void clear_screen(color clr);
// Show updated drawing
void refresh_screen();

// Get a color
color color_white();
color color_blue();
// and many others...

// Draw the outline or fill a circular area
void fill_circle(color clr, double x, double y, double radius);
void draw_circle(color clr, double x, double y, double radius);

// Draw the outline or fill a rectangular area
void fill_rectangle(color clr, double x, double y, double width, double height);
void draw_rectangle(color clr, double x, double y, double width, double height);

// Draw the outline or fill a elliptical area
void fill_ellipse(color clr, double x, double y, double width, double height);
void draw_ellipse(color clr, double x, double y, double width, double height);

// Draw the outline or fill a triangular area
void fill_triangle(color clr, double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2, double x3, double y3);
void draw_triangle(color clr, double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2, double x3, double y3);

// Draw a line (1 pixel wide)
void draw_line(color clr, double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2);

// Load an image and assign it a name
bitmap load_bitmap(string name, string filename);
// Draw a loaded image - using its name
void draw_bitmap(string name, double x, double y);

// Delay - waiting for a number of milliseconds before continuing
void delay(int milliseconds);
```

:::tip
These are method declarations - the code used to create a method. This code is in the library where these are made. You can call these in your code by using the name of the method, and passing it the values it asks for.

For example:
```cs
# This code creates open_window - a method you can call
window open_window(string caption, int width, int height);
```

To use it you would do something like:
```cs
# The method call -- with caption, width and height
open_window("Window Caption", 800, 600);
```

*What do the different arguments represent?*

When you open a window, you create an area onto which you can draw. The `width` and `height` arguments will determine how large the window is. You could create a 4 by 3 aspect ratio with something like 800 by 600, or a widescreen using 1280 by 720 - though you can create any shape window you want.

Shape drawing methods need a color to know what color shape to draw. You can get a color value by calling the different `Color...` methods such as `color_red()`, and pass that as the color argument value. Following the color, the methods indicate where the shape should appear, and its size. The position is indicated use `x` and `y` coordinates. The `x` value represents the distance from the left side of the window, while `y` is the distance from the *top* of the window. Size values will depend on the shape, a rectangle has a width and height, a circle has a radius, triangles have three points, etc.

We will explore this further as we go. For now, it is enough to remember that these methods exist.

## Example

The following example draws a house in a rectangular window.

```c++
#include "splashkit.h"

int main()
{
    // Open a window, before drawing to it
    open_window("A House", 800, 600);

    // Clear the screen to white - don't show it yet
    clear_screen(color_white());

    // Draw a hill like ellipse - only half of the ellipse is shown
    fill_ellipse(color_bright_green(), 0, 400, 800, 400);

    // Draw a house shape - rectangular walls, triangular roof
    fill_rectangle(color_gray(), 300, 300, 200, 200);
    fill_triangle(color_red(), 250, 300, 400, 150, 550, 300);

    // Now show the picture we have drawn to the user
    refresh_screen();

    // Wait for 5 seconds
    delay(5000);

    return 0;
}
```
