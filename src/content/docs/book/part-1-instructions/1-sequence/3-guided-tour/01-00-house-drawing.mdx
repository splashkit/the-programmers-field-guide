Let's get started with our first program! To kick things off we'll create a program that draws a simple house scene.

## Step 1: Understand what we want

    To build a program you must know what you are trying to create. So what do we want as output from this program? The following is an example of what we are after:

    ![House output](./images/house-shown.png)

    All the program needs to do is create a window, draw this scene inside it, and then show it for 5 seconds before closing. This will be a great way to get started with understanding sequence.

## Step 2: Understand what we need

    We'll be using the SplashKit library, which provides lots of procedures we can use to write this program. You will have seen some already in Part 0's [Guided Tour](/book/part-0-getting-started/1-building-programs/3-guided-tour/5-1-hello-world-gui/). So, what are the main procedures we need to be able to write this program? Have a think about _what_ the program is doing, and see if you can list four or five things -- for instance, "opening a window". Write them down!

    <details>
    <summary>Have you noted them down? Let's compare.</summary>
    The main four things we need, are to be able to...
    1. _open_ a window with a particular size.
    2. _draw_ rectangles, triangles, and ellipses, with different positions and colours.
    3. _show_ the drawing to the user.
    5. _delay_ for five seconds before closing.
    </details>

    Now that we know what we need, let's start putting it all together!

We will walk you through using drawing operations here, but if you want more details you can refer to the [graphical procedures](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence/5-reference/33-graphics) page in the [reference](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence/5-reference/00-program).
