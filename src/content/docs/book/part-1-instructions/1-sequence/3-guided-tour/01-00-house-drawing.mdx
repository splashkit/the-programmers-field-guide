As with the travel calculator, we want to get started quickly. So kick things off with a new folder, and a dotnet project called House Drawing.

1. Open your terminal, and set up your project

    ```zsh
    # Move you your code projects folder
    cd ~/Documents/Code # or cd /c/Users/andrew/Documents/Code
    
    # Create and move into a folder for the project
    mkdir HouseDrawing
    cd HouseDrawing

    # Create a blank dotnet project
    dotnet new console
    
    # Add the SplashKit library
    dotnet add package splashkit

    # Open in VS Code
    code .
    ```

2. Add the [using directives](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence/0-panorama/1-method-library) to access the SplashKit and Convert code.

    <Accordion>
      <AccordionItem header="Code with using directives">

    At this point you should just have these two lines of code.

    ```csharp
    using static System.Convert;
    using static SplashKitSDK.SplashKit;
    ```

      </AccordionItem>
    </Accordion>
