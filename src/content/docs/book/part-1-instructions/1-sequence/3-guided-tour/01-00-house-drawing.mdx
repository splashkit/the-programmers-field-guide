Let's get started with our first program! To kick things off we'll create a program that draws a simple house scene.

## Step 1: Understand what we want

    To build a program you must know what you are trying to create. So what do we want as output from this program? The following is an example of what we are after:

    ![House output](./images/house-shown.png)

    All the program needs to do is create a window, draw this scene inside it, and then show it for 5 seconds before closing - this will be a great way to get started with understanding sequence.

## Step 2: Understand what we need

    We'll be using the SplashKit library, which provides lots of procedures we can use to write this program - you will have seen some in Part 0's [Guided Tour](/book/part-0-getting-started/1-building-programs/3-guided-tour/5-1-hello-world-gui/). So what are the main procedures we need to be able to write this program? Have a think about _what_ the program is doing, and see if you can list four or five things - for instance, "opening a window". Write them down :)

    <details>
    <summary>Have you noted them down? Let's compare.</summary>
    The main four things we need, are to be able to...
    1. _open_ a window with a particular size.
    2. _draw_ rectangles, triangles, and ellipses, with different positions and colours.
    3. _show_ the drawing to the user.
    5. _delay_ for five seconds before closing.
    </details>

    Now that we know what we need, let's start putting it all together!
