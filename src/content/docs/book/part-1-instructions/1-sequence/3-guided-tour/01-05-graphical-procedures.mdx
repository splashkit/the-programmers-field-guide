Here's a list of some useful graphical procedures SplashKit provides. You'll find these come in handy when going through future tasks, feel free to refer to this page whenever needed.

```c++
// Open a window to draw to
// It is actually a function, but you can call it like a procedure
window open_window(string caption, int width, int height);

// Clear the current window to the indicated color
void clear_screen(color clr);
// Show updated drawing
void refresh_screen();

// Draw the outline or fill a circular area
void fill_circle(color clr, double x, double y, double radius);
void draw_circle(color clr, double x, double y, double radius);

// Draw the outline or fill a rectangular area
void fill_rectangle(color clr, double x, double y, double width, double height);
void draw_rectangle(color clr, double x, double y, double width, double height);

// Draw the outline or fill a elliptical area
void fill_ellipse(color clr, double x, double y, double width, double height);
void draw_ellipse(color clr, double x, double y, double width, double height);

// Draw the outline or fill a triangular area
void fill_triangle(color clr, double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2, double x3, double y3);
void draw_triangle(color clr, double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2, double x3, double y3);

// Draw a line (1 pixel wide)
void draw_line(color clr, double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2);

// Load an image and assign it a name
// This is also a function, but you can call it like a procedure
bitmap load_bitmap(string name, string filename);
// Draw a loaded image - using its name
void draw_bitmap(string name, double x, double y);

// Delay - waiting for a number of milliseconds before continuing
void delay(int milliseconds);
```

:::tip
These are **signatures** of the procedures from the library. You can call these in your code by using the name of the procedure, and passing it the values it asks for.

For example:

```c++
// This is the signature of a procedure to fill a circle
void fill_circle(color clr, double x, double y, double radius);
```

To use it you would do something like:

```c++
// The procedure call -- with its color, x, y, and its radius
fill_circle(COLOR_GREEN, 400, 300, 100);
```

### Color values

The color type is defined within SplashKit, and will be needed for many of the drawing operations. When you need a color, use of the many values defined in the library. These are documented on the Colors page, starting with [COLOR_ALICE_BLUE](https://splashkit.io/api/color/#color-alice-blue).

### What do the different arguments represent?

When you open a window, you create an area onto which you can draw. The `width` and `height` arguments will determine how large the window is. You could create a 4 by 3 aspect ratio with something like 800 by 600, or a widescreen using 1280 by 720 - though you can create any shape window you want.

Shape drawing procedures need a color to know what color shape to draw. You can get a color value using a `COLOR_...` value such as `COLOR_RED`, and pass that as the color argument value. Following the color, the procedures indicate where the shape should appear, and its size. The position is indicated use `x` and `y` coordinates. The `x` value represents the distance from the left side of the window, while `y` is the distance from the *top* of the window. Size values will depend on the shape, a rectangle has a width and height, a circle has a radius, triangles have three points, etc.

We will explore this further as we go. For now, it is enough to remember that these procedures exist.

## Example

The following example draws a house in a rectangular window.

```c++
#include "splashkit.h"

int main()
{
    // Open a window, before drawing to it
    open_window("A House", 800, 600);

    // Clear the screen to white - don't show it yet
    clear_screen(COLOR_WHITE);

    // Draw a hill like ellipse - only half of the ellipse is shown
    fill_ellipse(COLOR_BRIGHT_GREEN, 0, 400, 800, 400);

    // Draw a house shape - rectangular walls, triangular roof
    fill_rectangle(COLOR_GRAY, 300, 300, 200, 200);
    fill_triangle(COLOR_RED, 250, 300, 400, 150, 550, 300);

    // Now show the picture we have drawn to the user
    refresh_screen();

    // Wait for 5 seconds
    delay(5000);
}
```
