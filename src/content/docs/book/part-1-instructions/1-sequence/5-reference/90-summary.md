Programming with sequence involves the following:

- Thinking about the sequence of steps you need the computer to follow to get the outcome you want.
- Thinking about the libraries, and the procedures in those libraries, that you have available.

Break down your problems into small discrete steps, each of which gets you a little closer toward your goal.

An overview of these concepts is shown in the concept map below.

:::note[Summary]

- Constructs, or building blocks, are things that exist inside a program or library that you can use.
- Instructions capture the different *things* you can command the computer to do.
- A program is a **sequence** of instructions that use **data** to get the computer to do something.

In the next chapter we will look into how we can manipulate and store data in our programs.
