The concept of sequence applies to every program.
Now that we have seen this in action in a text-based program, let's add some complexity by including visuals.

Watch this video to:

- See how sequence is used in a graphical program.
- Understand how the sequence of drawing instructions can affect what you see.

When you have gone through this video you should have the main ideas on how to call graphical procedures, and be ready to explore these ideas further.

<CodeActivity projectName="Sequence/Intro/Coding a Graphical Sequence" fastStepping fastStepDelay="300">
```c++ {"userCode":5-14}
#include "splashkit.h"

int main()
{
    open_window("Hello Graphics", 800, 600);

    clear_screen(COLOR_BLUE);

    // Try drawing a rectangle here!
    ####

    refresh_screen();

    delay(2000);
}
```
:::tip
  We've slowed down the code so you can see sequence in action!

  Try experimenting with the order of the instructions, and see how the result changes.
