Let's get started building something, and we can then consider how it works and the different constructs we are working with.

Watch this video to:

- Revisit the steps needed to build and run programs.
- Get started calling procedures and getting them to do things.

When you have gone through this video you should have the main ideas on how to call procedures, and be ready to explore these ideas further.

<CodeActivity projectName="Sequence/Intro/Coding a Sequence">
```c++ {"userCode":5-8}
#include "splashkit.h"

int main()
{
    // Try calling write_line here!
    ####
    ####
    ####
}
```
:::tip
  Try writing a couple of lines of text to the terminal, by calling `write_line` multiple times.

  You could also try calling `delay`, which pauses the program for the specified number of milliseconds. Try adding `delay(200);` to pause the program briefly between lines!
