The while loop is a common feature of most programming languages. It is a pre-test loop, meaning that the statement starts with a condition, then a statement to be repeated. This means the code inside the loop will be repeated zero or more times, depending on the value of the condition. This is visualised in the following diagram.

![The pre-test Loop checks the condition, then runs the loop’s body](./images/loop-pre-test.png "The pre-test loop checks the condition, then runs the loop’s body")

## While -- when, why, and how

The while loop is a flexible way to have code repeated and will be used a lot in your programs. It should be your first thought when you want something to be repeated.

When planning to use a while loop, you first need to determine the condition that will indicate if the loop should be run. This condition determines if the computer continues into the while loop's body, or if the loop body is skipped and the sequence continues with the instructions that follow the loop.
You then want to make sure that something in the loop will change the condition so that there is a definite end to the loop. This could be reading a value from the user, or re-checking which events have occurred.

:::caution
At some point you will end up with an unexpected infinite loop. In these cases, you need to remember the details on how to [signal](../../../../part-0-getting-started/2-computer-use/1-concepts/08-signals) the operating system. You can use the ctrl-c to [kill](../../../../part-0-getting-started/2-computer-use/1-concepts/08-signals#killing-a-program-ctrl-c) the program.
:::

At a lower level, the while loop is achieved using two jump statements:

1. At the start of the loop, we have a conditional jump. If the condition is false, we jump to the instruction that follows the loop. Otherwise, control continues to flow in sequence to the loop's body (the statement following the condition).
2. At the end of the body of the loop, a jump statement is added to go back to the condition, and step 1 is repeated.

It is important to remember these actions that are performed. The while is just testing at the start, then either going into the body of the loop or jumping to the statement that follows. The value the condition evaluates to may change at any time, but it will only be checked when control is back at the top of the loop and the computer needs to determine whether to run the loop again or not.

:::tip
Remember everything is always in sequence. The word "while" seems to indicate that the code in the loop's body will only keep executing when the condition is true. If this were the case, our programs would suddenly be a lot more complex. For example, what happens if we are halfway through the body of a loop and the condition is suddenly false? Fortunately for us, this isn't how it works, so we don't need to worry. The condition is only checked when it is the instruction that is being run. So, you can retain the sequential, stepwise, thinking process as you picture how a loop works.

## In C#

:::tip[Syntax]
The following diagram shows the C# syntax for a while loop.

![While loop syntax.](./images/while-loop.png)
:::

In C# the while loop starts with the `while` keyword followed by the condition within parenthesis. The statement to be repeated follows this, which in almost all cases will be a [compound statement](../02-0-compound-statement).

## How does `while` work?

Let's work through two examples: a while loop for a terminal-based program and one for a graphical application using SplashKit.

### Counting with `while`

The following code provides a simple example of how to work with a while loop. In this program we want to output a count from 0 up to a target the user provides. To achieve this, we will need a variable for the target which will store the value the user enters. We will also need a variable to keep track of our count, indicating which value we are up to.

These steps are coded into the program below.
The user is asked to enter a number, which we store in the `target` variable, and we create a second variable (`i`) that we use to count the number of times the loop runs. Before the loop, `i` is set to 0 as we generally count from 0 in our code.

The while loop runs **while** `i` is less than the `target`. Within the loop, we use the `i++` [assignment statement](../../../1-sequence-and-data/1-concepts/08-assignment-statement) to increase the value of `i`. This means that the value of `i` will eventually be larger than or equal to the `target`, thereby ensuring the loop will end.

```csharp
using static System.Console;
using static System.Convert;

int target;

Write("Count to: ");
target = ToInt32(ReadLine());

int i =  0;

while (i < target)
{
    WriteLine(i);
    i++;
}
```

:::tip[Why i?]
You will very often need to create working variables, like `i`, to help keep track of things for you. In this case, `i` is keeping track of the number of times the loop is run. When we have a simple integer value to track a count of something, we generally call this `i`. It comes from Fortran, an early language, where integer variables started with `i`. Developers then generally just used `i` if the variable had a simple counting purpose - it saved time thinking about what to call the variable and was easy to type. It stuck, and is now a common practice.

### Keeping graphical programs running

Now let's look at how we can use a while loop to keep a window open in SplashKit. In this case, we can use the `QuitRequested` method from SplashKit to find out if the user has asked to quit the program by closing the SplashKit window on their screen. `QuitRequested` will return `false` if the user has not asked to quit, so we need to loop **while** quit is **not** requested. Remember, in C# we use `!` for "not", giving us a condition `!QuitRequested()` for our loop.

Within the loop, we need to tell SplashKit to respond to any events the user has performed. This is achieved with the `ProcessEvents()` method. It reads things like key presses, mouse movements, and window closes, and retains this information so that you can access it using other methods. In this case, it will record if the user has asked to quit, and we're accessing this information when we call `QuitRequested` in the condition. If you forget to add the call to `ProcessEvents` then you will not be able to close the window. In these cases, switch to the terminal and kill the program with [ctrl-c](../../../../part-0-getting-started/2-computer-use/1-concepts/08-signals).

```csharp
using static SplashKitSDK.SplashKit;

OpenWindow("Circle Test", 400, 400);
ClearScreen(ColorWhite());

while (!QuitRequested())
{
    FillCircle(RandomColor(), Rnd(ScreenWidth()), Rnd(ScreenHeight()), Rnd(50));
    RefreshScreen();

    ProcessEvents();
}
```

Use the following images to see how this runs.

If you have looked at sample code for most windowed programs online, you will not have seen this loop. This is what is generally known as an **event loop**, which the libraries usually take care of for you. That is great for productivity, but not great when you are trying to learn how this all works. With SplashKit we want you to be in control, so you need to create something like this loop to keep things going. When you move on to professional libraries, you will then have a good idea of what they are doing for you in the background.
