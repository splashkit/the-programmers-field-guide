title: Terminal methods to use

import { YouTube } from 'astro-embed';

In Sequence and Data, we were able to use a number of methods from the .NET System libraries and SplashKit in order to produce outputs and read values from the user. Now that we have control flow, there are a number of additional methods that you can use to help with your projects.

## Terminal Methods

</div>

In addition to `WriteLine`, `Write`, `ReadLine`, and the convert methods we will now need ways to check if data provided has the right format. The .NET library doesn't have an easy way to do this, but we can make use of the following SplashKit methods for now:

```cs
public static bool SplashKit.IsDouble(string text);
public static bool SplashKit.IsInteger(string text);
```

These methods will allow you to test if a string can be converted to an integer or a double. You can use these to perform simple validations, by using this as the condition in a loop. For example, the following validates the entry of a double value.

```c++
#include "splashkit.h"

int main()
{
    string line;
    double value;

    write("Please enter a number: ");
    line = read_line();
    while (!is_double(line))
    {
      write_line("Sorry, I cannot convert " + line + " to a number.");
      write("Please enter a number: ");
      line = read_line();
    }
    value = to_double(line);

    write_line("Thanks you I got " + to_string(value));
}
```

:::caution
Make sure you are not using the `System.Console` code. Both SplashKit and Console provide `WriteLine`, `Write`, and `ReadLine` methods. To avoid getting the compiler confused, make sure you are `using static SplashKitSDK.SplashKit;` and *do not* add the code to use `System.Console`.
