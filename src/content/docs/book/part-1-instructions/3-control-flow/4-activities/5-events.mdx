<NoCopy>
With interactive programs you can use control flow to create an event loop that allows you to respond to things that change such as user input, button presses, temperature changes, etc.

For this program, create a graphical application that will let the user draw circles to the screen. It should respond to the following events:

- Starts with a clear white screen
- When the user presses "c" it clears the screen to a random color
- Initially the radius of any added circle will be 50
  - if the user presses "s", set the radius to 10
  - if the user presses "m", set the radius to 50
  - if the user presses "l", set the radius to 100
- If the user clicks, draw a circle with the current radius at the current mouse x and mouse y in a random color.
