Build a simple music player that lets the user load and play songs.
This program will:

- Show a menu for the user to select from
- Allows the user to load a song from a file
- Outputs a message to confirm if the music file was loaded
- Allows the user to play a song
- Will output a message if they try to play something they have not loaded
- Allows the user to stop the music
- Will output a message if they try to stop music and nothing is playing

Here is an example of the output from this:

:::tip
You can check if [Load Music](https://splashkit.io/api/audio/#load-music) succeeded by calling [Has Music](https://splashkit.io/api/audio/#has-music). If this returns false, then it failed to load the music.
