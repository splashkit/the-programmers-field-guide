Build a simple statistics calculator. This will keep a running count, total, and average.

This program will:

- Ask the user to enter a value
- Validate user input, ensuring that the value entered is a number
- Keep track of the number of values entered
- Output the number of values entered, the total, and average
- Ask the user if they want to add another value, and repeat the above if they enter anything other than "n", "N", or "no"
