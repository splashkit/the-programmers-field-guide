Build a simple statistics calculator. This will keep a running count and total, as well as the minimum and maximum, for values entered by the user. When a value is entered, the program can update and output the count, total, minimum, maximum, and average.

:::caution
Make sure the calculations work with entry of any valid number (that can be stored in a double).

For minimum and maximum, see if you can achieve this using control flow rather than setting the initial values to anything in particular. Don't use `DBL_MAX`/`std::numeric_limits<double>::max()` or `DBL_MIN`/`std::numeric_limits<double>::lowest()`.
:::

:::tip[Hint]
If there is only one value entered, then you can set `min` and `max` to that value.
