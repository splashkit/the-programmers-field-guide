To conclude the change calculator we need to make this so that the user has the option to calculate another change value. The logic for this is shown in the following flow chart.

![Flowchart showing a block within a do while that is checking if the user wants to run again.](./images/change-calc-2-loop.png)

1. Add a new `again` variable, write out a prompt, and read in the new value at the end of the current code.
2. Add in a `do...while` loop that will repeat while `again` is not equal "N" or "n".

    :::tip
    While you might be thinking the condition for this loop needs to be "repeat while again does not equal 'N' **or** 'n'", in code you would actually need to use `again != "N" && again != "n"`.
    :::

    Go ahead and try implementing this. Make sure the `do while` loop, captures the code that reads the values from the users, as well as the code that outputs the change values.

    Compile, run, and test. Make sure that you can loop multiple times, and exit when you want. Test the program, and see if you can spot any issues.

    :::tip
    Make sure that you nest the existing code within the loop as a [compound statement](/book/part-1-instructions/3-control-flow/5-reference/02-0-compound-statement). Once you code the loop you can select the existing code in Visual Studio Code and press *tab* to indent it all one level further. You can also right-click and select "Format Document" to help with code layout.
    :::

3. To complete the program, we can need to check if the user has paid enough. If they have not paid enough, then we should output a message and see if they want to calculate change again.

    Have a go at this yourself. There are several ways you can achieve this.

      In this solution we use a `continue;` statement to jump to the condition of the `do ... while` when there is insufficient funds.
