# Raspberry Pi GPIO Functions

Welcome to the guide on Raspberry Pi GPIO functions with SplashKit! In this guide, you’ll learn about the basic functions that let you interact with your Raspberry Pi’s pins. These functions help you initialize the GPIO system, read sensor values, write outputs, and clean up afterward.

## Key Functions

- **RaspiInit()**  
  Initializes the GPIO system. Always call this at the very start of your program to prepare the pins for use.

- **RaspiCleanup()**  
  Resets and cleans up the GPIO settings when your program ends. This is essential to prevent any unintended behavior.

- **RaspiGetMode(pin)**  
  Retrieves the current mode (input, output, etc.) of a specific GPIO pin.

- **RaspiRead(pin)**  
  Reads the current value from a GPIO pin (typically HIGH or LOW). This is used for sensors like push buttons.

- **RaspiSetMode(pin, mode)**  
  Sets the mode of a GPIO pin. For example, you might set a pin to input mode for a sensor or output mode for an LED.

- **RaspiSetPullUpDown(pin, pull)**  
  Configures the internal pull-up or pull-down resistors for a GPIO pin, which helps ensure a stable signal when no input is provided.

- **RaspiSetPwmDutycycle(pin, duty)**  
  Adjusts the duty cycle of a PWM signal on a pin. This is useful for controlling things like motor speed or LED brightness.

- **RaspiSetPwmFrequency(pin, frequency)**  
  Sets the frequency for PWM output on a GPIO pin.

- **RaspiSetPwmRange(pin, range)**  
  Defines the range (or resolution) for PWM values.

- **RaspiSpiOpen(...)**, **RaspiSpiTransfer(...)**, **RaspiSpiClose()**  
  These functions help open an SPI connection, transfer data, and close the connection, respectively.

- **RaspiWrite(pin, value)**  
  Writes a digital value (HIGH or LOW) to a GPIO pin. This function is how you control outputs like LEDs.

> **Note:**  
> In future lessons, we will add a few more functions for managing pin types, setting different pin modes, and even working with I²C functions. For now, focus on these core functions to get comfortable with basic GPIO operations.

Enjoy experimenting with these functions and start creating your own interactive projects!
