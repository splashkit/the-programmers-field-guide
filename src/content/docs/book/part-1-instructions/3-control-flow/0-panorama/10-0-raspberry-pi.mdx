# Control Flow in Raspberry pi

Welcome to the Control Flow chapter! In this section, you’ll discover how to make your Raspberry Pi projects interactive by learning how to control the flow of your programs. Control flow is all about making decisions and reacting to inputs—turning your simple sensor readings into dynamic, real-world actions.

**What’s Fun About This Chapter?**

- **Interactive Projects:** Watch your code come alive as it reads sensors and controls outputs.
- **Real-World Impact:** Use sensors like buttons, potentiometers, and more to build smart devices.
- **Step-by-Step Learning:** Each guide builds on the previous one, helping you master both programming concepts and hardware interactions.

To dive deeper, explore these guides:

- **[Raspberry Pi GPIO Functions](/book/part-1-instructions/3-control-flow/0-panorama/10-1-gpio-functions/)**  
  Learn the basics of initializing, reading, writing, and cleaning up GPIO pins on your Raspberry Pi using SplashKit.

- **[Introduction to ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)](/book/part-1-instructions/3-control-flow/0-panorama/10-2-adc/)**  
  Discover what an ADC is, why you need it for reading analog sensors, and how it converts real-world signals into digital data.

- **[Exploring the Potentiometer](/book/part-1-instructions/3-control-flow/0-panorama/10-3-exploring-potentiometer/)**  
  Understand how a potentiometer works, how to wire it with an ADC, and how to use it to control your projects.  
  *Tip:* Try using the `rnd()` function to add a fun twist to your projects by generating random target values.

Embark on this journey of control flow, where each concept you learn empowers you to create something smarter. Happy coding!
