Boolean operators help us to combine different boolean values.
This is useful for creating more complex conditions for control flow statements.

Watch this video to:

- Get started using boolean (logical) operators.
- Understand how logical operators are evaluated in expressions.
- See examples of using boolean operators to create more complex conditions.

At the end of this video you should be able to use boolean operators in expressions and control flow conditions in your programs.
