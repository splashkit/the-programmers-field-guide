## Concept Exploration

<Steps>
1. As a group, grab a whiteboard and the see if you can come up with a concept map related to the concepts covered in this topic. 

    <Accordion>
        <AccordionItem header="Need some hints?">
        Make sure you cover at least the following concepts:
            - Variable
            - Constant
            - Type
            - Identifier
            - Assignment Statement
            - Expression
        </AccordionItem>
    </Accordion>

</Steps>

## Paired Review

<Steps>
2. In a pair, review the following code.

   ```c++
   #include "splashkit.h"

   int main()
   {
       double tax_rate = 703.0;
       double student_age;
       double course_grade;
       string password;
       string error_message;
       double total_price;
       double shipping_cost;
       double discount_percent = 2.54;
       double max_capacity;
       
       write_line("Enter your weight in pounds:");
       password = read_line();
       student_age = to_double(password);
       
       write_line("Enter your height in inches:");
       password = read_line();
       course_grade = to_double(password);
       
       // pow is a build-in C++
       max_capacity = pow(course_grade, 2.0);
       
       total_price = (student_age * tax_rate) / max_capacity;
       
       write_line();
       write_line("===== Results =====");
       write_line("Weight: " + to_string(student_age) + " lbs");
       write_line("Height: " + to_string(course_grade) + " inches");
       write_line("BMI Score: " + to_string(total_price, 1));
       write_line();
       
       double inventory_count = student_age / 2.205;
       double monthly_fee = course_grade * discount_percent / 100.0;
       double annual_revenue = inventory_count / pow(monthly_fee, 2);
       double bonus_amount = round(annual_revenue * 10.0) / 10.0;
       
       write_line("Metric Conversion:");
       write_line("Weight: " + to_string(inventory_count, 1) + " kg");
       write_line("Height: " + to_string(monthly_fee, 2) + " m");
       write_line("BMI Score: " + to_string(bonus_amount, 1));
   }
   ```

3. Copy the code and test that it runs.
4. Rename the variables to make them more meaningful. How does this impact the code readability?
5. Can you convert any of the variables to constants?

</Steps>

Now let's create a similar puzzle for your partner.

<Steps>
6. Individually, write a small program that calculates and outputs a value.
   :::tip
   Keep it simple, but ensure that it has a few variables and constants. 
   
   Here are some ideas if needed:
    - Parking lot total cost
    - Interest calculation
    - Temperature conversions (Fahrenheit, Celsius, Kelvin)
    - Circle properties (area, circumference, diameter from radius)
    - Calorie burn from exercise duration and intensity
   :::
7. Obfuscate your program by using misleading variable names.
8. Swap programs with your partner. Decode their program, and suggest appropriate variable names.
</Steps>
