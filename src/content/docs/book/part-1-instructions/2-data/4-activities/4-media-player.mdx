Make sure to read about [playing music in SplashKit](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence/5-reference/34-audio) for this task.
:::
<NoCopy>

We can use sequence and data to play around with the sound playing features of SplashKit. This program will ask the user to enter the path to a sound effect to play, how long to play it for, an initial volume and a final volume. This will then output messages saying what it is doing, while it plays the music.
