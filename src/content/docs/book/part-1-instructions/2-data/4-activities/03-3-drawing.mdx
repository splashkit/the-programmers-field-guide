For this task you can build on the ideas from the [house drawing](/book/part-1-instructions/2-data/3-guided-tour/02-00-house-drawing) tour. You may also find it useful to read about [drawing in SplashKit](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence/2-trailside/11-2-graphics/#drawing-to-a-window) and [playing sound effects in SplashKit](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence/2-trailside/11-3-audio) for this task.

Create a program that draws a custom scene, picture, or animation using shapes and colors from SplashKit - while sticking with just sequence and data.

- Make sure to draw at least 3 shapes, or have a few steps in your animation
- Provide some calculated elements to the scene, that the user can input. Something like the position, size, or speed of a component is sufficient.

This could be a simple image like a car or flower shape, or you could combine text, delays, drawing, and sound effects to create an animation.

For example, the following is a starter/trailer for some scary game. The user would change the speed of the animation by scaling the delay time. Use this for inspiration.

```txt
Welcome friend. What is your name: Andrew
Hello Andrew,
What are you most scared of? Spiders
Delay speed scale? [100 to 1000]: 750

You are approaching what looks like a haunted house
(delay - scale by speed scale factor)
(play door creak sound effect - delay scaled)
It is dark in here...
Andrew! (delay then print) Spiders everywhere!
(open window - show black - delay)
(draw scary picture - play scream sound effect - short delay)
(draw black screen - short delay)
(draw scary picture again - short delay)
(draw black screen - short delay)
(draw scary picture again - with "game" logo below and the text "coming soon")
```

Hopefully that gives you an idea of what you could do here.

:::caution

Don't spend too long on this, but with a little time you should be able to draw something interesting or show a few images and maybe play a few sound effects.
