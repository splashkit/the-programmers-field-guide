So far our programs contain a sequence of instructions. These foundations are important, but a bit limiting, as our programs will always do the same thing. Let's explore how we can change that.

At the end of this trek, make sure you:

- Continue to focus on a sequence of actions, and building on what you learnt in earlier chapters.
- Can create programs that include:
  - Variables to store values that change.
  - Assignment statements to store values in variables.
  - Function calls to calculate values.
- Demonstrate how the different statements work, and interact with values in memory.
