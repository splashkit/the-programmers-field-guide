Next, let's calculate the current average speed.

```txt {7-8}
What is your name: Andrew

Hi Andrew.

How far have you travelled so far? Enter km: 5.2
How long has it taken? Enter minutes: 7

Your average speed is 44.57142857142857 km/h
```

<Steps>
1. New variables and constants?

    We will need to store the speed. We can calculate this as `distance` divided by, `time` divided by 60. Where 60 represents minutes per hour.

    We can track the speed by adding a `speed` variable, but we should also add a `MINUTES_PER_HOUR` constant to make this meaningful in our code.

2. Add the code to calculate the speed and output the speed.

    :::tip
    Code `MINUTES_PER_HOUR` above the other variables. It is good to keep constants and variables together. Remember to watch the case you use: `snake_case` for variables, and `UPPER_CASE` for constants. This helps keep our code clear.

    ```c++ {3-4,28-32}
    #include "splashkit.h"

    const int MINUTES_PER_HOUR = 60;

    int main()
    {
        string name;
        string user_input;
        double distance, time;
        double speed;

        write("What is your name: ");
        name = read_line();

        write_line();

        write_line("Hi " + name + ".");

        write_line();

        write("How far have you travelled so far? Enter km: ");
        user_input = read_line();
        distance = to_double(user_input);

        write("How long has it taken? Enter minutes: ");
        user_input = read_line();
        time = to_double(user_input);

        speed = distance / (time / MINUTES_PER_HOUR);

        write_line();
        write_line("Your average speed is " + to_string(speed) + " km/h");
    }
    ```

3. Compile and run your program. Check the output matches what we are after.

    :::note

    Make sure to check your calculations. Is the output correct?
