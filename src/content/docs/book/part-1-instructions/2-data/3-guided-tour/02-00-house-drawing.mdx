title: Dynamic House Drawing
---

In the last part we worked on a [House Drawing program](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence/3-guided-tour/01-00-house-drawing/), but identified that our house is currently drawn using hard-coded values for each shape. It would be difficult to resize or move the house without manually re-calculating each of the coordinates.

We'll now upgrade our House Drawing program to _dynamically calculate_ the positions and sizes of the shapes we draw, by using variables and expressions! This is the first step to creating much more interesting graphical programs - such as ones with graphical interfaces - or games.
