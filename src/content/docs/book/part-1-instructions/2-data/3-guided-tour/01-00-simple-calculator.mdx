For this part of the guided tour, we will build a travel calculator that can estimate your arrival time based on your current average speed and the remaining distance to travel.

## Step 1: Understand what we want

Similar to our previous programs, we first need to understand what we're aiming for. Below is an example of the output of the program we're trying to create.

```txt
What is your name: Andrew

Hi Andrew.

How far have you travelled so far? Enter km: 5.2
How long has it taken? Enter minutes: 7

Your average speed is 44.5714285714 km/h

How far do you have to go? Enter km: 57.3

You will take another 77.134615384615385 minutes before you arrive
Total distance will be 62.5 km
Total time will be 84.1346153846 minutes
```

Before we get started, let's take a look at the procedures and functions we can use to interact with the terminal.
