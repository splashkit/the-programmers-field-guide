Now that we know what functions/procedures we can use, let's get started. Best first step is to build something small, then we can grow the program our from that start. Let's just get the first two messages handled - reading the user's name and displaying it. So we want to see this at the end:

```txt
What is your name: Andrew

Hi Andrew.
```

<Steps>

1. Open a folder in VS Code, and create a new `.cpp` file.

2. Start by adding the [#include directive](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence/5-reference/10-library/#in-c) to access the SplashKit library, and an empty [`main`](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence/3-guided-tour/01-01-main/).

    <Accordion>
      <AccordionItem header="Code with #include directive">

    At this point you should just have these lines of code.

    ```c++
    #include "splashkit.h"

    int main()
    {
        // Our main code will go here!
    }
    ```

      </AccordionItem>
    </Accordion>

3. As you look at this you, think about whether there are any values that will change. We will need to create [variables](/book/part-1-instructions/2-data/5-reference/10-variable/) to store these.

    Looking at the first lines, I imagine that we may have different users run this. So their name may change.

    :::tip[What type of data would this be?]
    Is this a string, int, or double? String is for text, int whole numbers, and double for real numbers.
    :::

4. Add the code to create a `name` variable - then we can think about how we use this.

5. Review the messages we want to output. To start we want to output the message `"What is your name: "`, read the text and user enters, then output a blank line and the greeting text `"Hi "` followed by the user's name.
  
    Looking at the [terminal procedures/functions](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence/5-reference/11-1-terminal-to-use), we have procedures to output text (`write` and `write_line`), and functions to read text from the user (`read_line`). Use these to display the prompt, and output the required messages.

    <Accordion>
      <AccordionItem header="Reading and using the user name">

    ```c++ {5-11}
    #include "splashkit.h"

    int main()
    {
        string name;
        write("What is your name: ");
        name = read_line();

        write_line();
        write_line("Hi " + name + ".");
        write_line();
    }
    ```

      </AccordionItem>
    </Accordion>

6. Now compile and run the program to see the output. Check it against what we were aiming to achieve.

    :::note

    Notice how you have a sequence of instructions, and can use variables to store data. Try entering different names.
