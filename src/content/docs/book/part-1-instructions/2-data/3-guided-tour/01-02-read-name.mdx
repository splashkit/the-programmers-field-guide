Let's get started! The best first step is to build something small, then we can grow the program our from there. So, let's start by getting just the first two messages handled: reading the user's name and displaying it. When we're done our program output should look like this:

```txt
What is your name: Andrew

Hi Andrew.
```

<Steps>

1. Open a folder in VS Code, and create a new `.cpp` file.

2. Start by adding the [#include directive](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence/5-reference/30-library/#in-c) to access the SplashKit library, and an empty [`main`](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence/3-guided-tour/01-01-main/).

    <Accordion>
      <AccordionItem header="Code with #include directive">

    At this point you should just have these lines of code.

    ```c++
    #include "splashkit.h"

    int main()
    {
        // Our main code will go here!
    }
    ```

      </AccordionItem>
    </Accordion>

3. Think about whether there are any values that will change. We will need to create [variables](/book/part-1-instructions/2-data/5-reference/10-variable/) to store these.

    Looking at the first lines of our sample program output, I imagine that we may have different users run the program. So, the name value may change.

    :::tip[What type of data would this be?]
    Is this a string, int, or double? String is for text, int whole numbers, and double for real numbers.
    :::

4. Add the code to create a `name` variable.

5. Review sample program output again. To start we want to output the message `"What is your name: "`, then read the text the user enters, then output a blank line and the greeting text `"Hi "` followed by the name the user entered.
  
    Looking at the [terminal procedures](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence/5-reference/32-terminal-to-use), we have procedures to output text (`write` and `write_line`). SplashKit also provides a [function](/book/part-1-instructions/2-data/5-reference/30-function/) to read text from the user (`read_line`). Use these to get the user's name and output the required messages.

    <Accordion>
      <AccordionItem header="Reading and using the user name">

    ```c++ {5-11}
    #include "splashkit.h"

    int main()
    {
        string name;
        write("What is your name: ");
        name = read_line();

        write_line();
        write_line("Hi " + name + ".");
        write_line();
    }
    ```

      </AccordionItem>
    </Accordion>

6. Now compile and run the program to see the output. Check it against what we were aiming to achieve.

    :::note

    Notice how you have a sequence of instructions, and can use variables to store data. Try running your program several times, entering different names.
