Best first step is to build something small, then we can grow the program our from that start. Let's just get the first two messages handled - reading the user's name and displaying it. So we want to see this at the end:

```txt
What is your name: Andrew

Hi Andrew.
```

<Steps>

1. Open a folder in VS Code, and create a new `.cpp` file.

2. Start by adding the [#include directive](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence/0-panorama/1-method-library) to access the SplashKit library, and an empty [`main` function](TODO).

    <Accordion>
      <AccordionItem header="Code with #include directive">

    At this point you should just have these lines of code.

    ```c++
    #include "splashkit.h"

    int main()
    {
        // Our main code will go here!
        return 0;
    }
    ```

      </AccordionItem>
    </Accordion>

4. As you look at this you, think about whether there are any values that will change. We will need to create [variables](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence-and-data/0-panorama/3-variables) to store these.

    Looking at the first lines, I imagine that we may have different users run this. So their name may change.

    :::tip[What type of data would this be?]
    Is this a string, int, or double? String is for text, int whole numbers, and double for real numbers.
    :::

5. Add the code to create a `name` variable - then we can think about how we use this.

6. Review the messages we want to output. To start we want to output the message `"What is your name: "`, read the text and user enters, then output a blank line and the greeting text `"Hi "` followed by the user's name.
  
    Looking back at the [terminal methods](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence/0-panorama/6-terminal-method-to-use), we have methods to output text (`write` and `write_line`), and read text from the user (`read_line`). Use these to display the prompt, and output the required messages.

    <Accordion>
      <AccordionItem header="Reading and using the user name">

    ```c++ {5-11}
    #include "splashkit.h"

    int main()
    {
        string name;
        write("What is your name: ");
        name = read_line();

        write_line();
        write_line("Hi " + name + ".");
        write_line();

        return 0;
    }
    ```

      </AccordionItem>
    </Accordion>

7. Now compile and run the program to see the output. Check it against what we were aiming to achieve.

    :::note

    Notice how you have a sequence of instructions, and can use variables to store data. Try entering different names.
