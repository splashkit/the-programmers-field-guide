You have now seen how to work with values in the terminal.
Next, have a go at finishing off this program.
The remaining output needs you to

* Get the distance remaining in the trip from the user.
* Calculate and show the time remaining in the trip.
* Calculate and show the total distance covered in the trip.
* Calculate and show the total time the trip has taken.

:::tip

Do this in steps! Just like in the previous steps, do a small part, compile and run to make sure it works, then repeat until you are done.

        write("How far do you have to go? Enter km: ");
        user_input = read_line();
        remaining_distance = to_double(user_input);

        time_to_destination = remaining_distance / speed * MINUTES_PER_HOUR;

        write_line("You will take another " + to_string(time_to_destination) + " minutes before you arrive");

        total_distance = distance + remaining_distance;
        total_time = time + time_to_destination;

        write_line("Total distance will be " + to_string(total_distance) + " km");
        write_line("Total time will be " + to_string(total_time) + " minutes");
    }
    ```

Make sure to test your program and make sure that the values it outputs are correct.

:::note

Building this all in steps is **very** important! There is lots going on in the code, so at the start you don't want to plan too far ahead. As you gain more practice and experience you can then start to design and implement larger parts of the code at once, but you still end up coding it a little at a time and adjusting your plans as you go.

:::

When you finish this you should feel confident that you can build some small terminal calculation programs on your own.
