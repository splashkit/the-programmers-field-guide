Functions are used to calculate values, which is very useful for creating interesting programs.

Watch this video to:

- See how to call functions and use the value they return.

When you have gone through this video you should be able to call functions in your programs.

  The code below draws four randomly positioned circles. It uses the `rnd(int max)` function to compute random values for the positions - it returns a random number between 0 and max.

  Try running it, and observe the order the functions are called in.

```c++ {"userCode":5-21}
#include "splashkit.h"

int main()
{
    open_window("Hello Functions", 800, 600);

    clear_screen(COLOR_WHITE);

    fill_circle(COLOR_RED, rnd(800), rnd(600), 20);
    refresh_screen();

    fill_circle(COLOR_RED, rnd(800), rnd(600), 20);
    refresh_screen();

    fill_circle(COLOR_RED, rnd(800), rnd(600), 20);
    refresh_screen();

    fill_circle(COLOR_RED, rnd(800), rnd(600), 20);
    refresh_screen();

    delay(2000);
}
```

  Can you spot how each `rnd` is called first, and _then_ the result is used in the `fill_circle` function?
