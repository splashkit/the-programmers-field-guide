Now that we have a variable, let's see how to update its value.

Watch this video to:

- Get started using the assignment statement.
- Use the assignment statement to assign a value to a variable.

After this video you should be ready to use dynamic values within your programs.

  Your assignment is to try out _assignment_! :) A few variables have been declared in the code below - try writing assignment statements that change their values, then run the code and watch how they update.

  For this one, we've given you complete control over stepping through the code. **Once started, use the `Next Step` button to move to the next line**.

```c++ {"userCode":5-19}
#include "splashkit.h"

int main()
{
    int x, y;
    string text;
    double a_double;

    x = 20;
    x += 5;
    y = x + 5;
    text = to_string(y) + "!";

    // Try assigning to a_double, or modifying any of the other variables!
    ####
}
```
