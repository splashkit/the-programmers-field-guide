Variables are used to store values that may change while your program is running. A good place to start with this is to use variables to accept input from the user.

Watch this video to:

- Get started declaring and using variables.
- See how to use functions to calculate values to store in variables.

When you are done, you should be able to create variables in your code and have a mental model of what is occurring.

:::tip
  Try running the code below and watching as the variables are created and assigned values. Try re-running with different values, and see how the output changes.
:::
```c++ {"userCode":5-13}
#include "splashkit.h"

int main()
{
    write("What is your name? ");
    string name = read_line();

    write_line("Hello " + name);

    int name_length = length_of(name);
    string name_length_str = to_string(name_length);

    write_line("Your name is " + name_length_str + " bytes long!");
}
```
