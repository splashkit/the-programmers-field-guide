While fixed literal values are useful, to make programs dynamic you need to be able to work with values that change.

A **variable** is a **building block** you can use to store a value that you can change as the program runs. You can picture a variable as a **container** into which you can store a value and retrieve it later.

![Variables store a value that can be read and changed](./images/variable-concept.png "Variables store a value that can be read and changed")

## Variables -- when, why, and how

Variables are an invaluable tool to help you build digital realities.
They allow you to capture simple values, associate them with a name -- the variable's **identifier** -- and change the value within your code.
You can also use the variable to retrieve (i.e., read) the value it contains.

Whenever you have information in your program that you want to be able to change, you create a variable to store it. Every variable has a [data type](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence/5-reference/06-type/), which needs to match the kind of data you want to store.
After you define a variable with an **identifier** and [**data type**](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence/5-reference/06-type/), you need to **initialise** it with a starting value.
Then, you can then read the current value and store new values in the variable as the program runs and the information the variable represents changes.

## In C++

:::tip[Syntax]
Variables can be declared in C++ using the following syntax:

![The syntax for variable declarations in C++.](./images/variable-declaration.png "The syntax for variable declarations in C++")

<CommmonLink type="syntaxDiagramGuide"/>
:::

Variables need to include the [type](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence/5-reference/06-type/) of data you want to store. Then, you provide a name (identifier) for the variable.
A variable can optionally be given a value when it is declared.
You can also declare multiple variables in the one line of code, as long as they are of the same data type.

By convention, variables should have a **snake_case** name, where the first letter is lowercase and each new word in the identifier is separated with an underscore character (`_`). For example, `bottle_volume`.

## Examples

### Basic Example

In this program, we want to capture the user's name and greet them using it. We need a variable for the name, as it may change each time the program runs. Within the program, the variable will represent the name of the user.

```c++
#include "splashkit.h"

int main()
{
    // Create a variable called name
    // it can store a string
    string name;

    // Output the message
    write_line("What is your name?");
    write("name: ");

    // Read user input and store it in the name variable
    name = read_line();

    write_line();
    write_line("Hello " + name);
}
```

### Example using multiple variables

Let's use SplashKit to see how multiple variables can be used in a graphical program. The following program draws a circle, after asking the user for the circle's radius and color. To achieve this, we will need the following variables:

- Numbers for the `radius` and `hue`, which the user will enter.
- A string `line` to store the text the user enters before we convert it to a number.

We use `read_line` to read a `string` from the user, and `to_double` to convert the text read into a `double` value. These values are stored in the `radius` and `hue` variables, which can then be used in the call to `fill_circle`.

```c++
#include "splashkit.h"

int main()
{
    string line;
    double radius, hue;

    write_line("Welcome to Circle Drawer!");
    write_line();
    write_line("Enter the radius of the circle to draw. (a whole number)");

    // Read value from the user and convert to double for radius
    write("Circle radius: ");
    line = read_line();
    radius = to_double(line);

    // Read value from the user and convert to double for hue
    write_line("What color? Enter hue between 0 to 1");
    write("Hue: ");
    line = read_line();
    hue = to_double(line);

    // Draw scene and delay
    open_window("Circle Drawing", 800, 600);
    clear_screen(color_white());
    fill_circle(h_s_b_color(hue, 0.8, 0.8), 400, 300, radius);
    refresh_screen();
    delay(5000);
}
```

:::tip
Notice how the names of the variables help us understand how the program works. In this, we are building the things we need in the digital reality that exists as the program runs.

Adding in additional line breaks also helps group the steps in our code to make it more readable.

## Activities

For each piece of information, try to identify the data type needed, and think of a name. Then, try writing the C++ code to declare that variable.

1. The temperature on a planet in a space exploration game (in degrees Celsius).
2. The number of lives a character has left in a video game.
3. The username of someone logging into a website.

<details>
  <summary role="button">Answers</summary>
  There are other acceptable answers for the identifiers.
  The key to a good identifier is that it is short and meaningful.
  It should also follow the C++ conventions, for instance by using snake_case for variables.
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1: </strong> <code>double planet_temperature;</code></li>
    <li><strong>2: </strong> <code>int lives_remaining;</code></li>
    <li><strong>3: </strong> <code>string username;</code></li>
  </ul>
</details>

:::note[Summary]

- Variables are **building blocks** you can create to store values in your programs.
- You can think of a variable as a box. The variable is the box, and its value is stored within it.
- Each variable has a ...
  - **name** (identifier) that can be used to refer to it.
  - **type** that determines its size and how its value is interpreted.
  - **value** that it is storing.
- The first time you assign a value to a variable, you are **initialising** it.
- You can **read** the value from variables in your instructions.
- A variable **is not** its value -- it is a container that stores a value, but its value can change over time as you write new values into the variable.

## Debugging
Variables are fundamental and powerful tools in programming, but with that power comes the possibility for new types of bugs to emerge. Let's see how to view and manipulate variables in VS Code's debugger!
