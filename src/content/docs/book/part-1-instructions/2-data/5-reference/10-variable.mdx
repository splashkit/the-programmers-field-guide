While fixed literal values are useful, to make programs dynamic you need to be able to work with values that change.

A **variable** is a **construct** you can create to store a value that you can change as the program runs. You can picture a variable as a **container** into which you can store a value and retrieve it later.

![Variables store a value that can be read and changed](./images/variable-concept.png "Variables store a value that can be read and changed")

## Variables -- when, why, and how

Variables are an invaluable tool to help you build digital realities.
They allow you to capture simple values, associate them with a name -- the variable's **identifier** -- and change the value within your code.
You can also use the variable to retrieve (i.e., read) the value it contains.

When you think about your program, try to identify the different things (data/information) that you want to change. For each of these, create a variable.

You will need to give each variable a [data type](/book/part-1-instructions/2-data/5-reference/06-type/). This will determine the kind of information stored - if you want text use the `string` type, use `int` for whole number, or `double` for real numbers. We will learn about other types you can use and create in later chapters.

Then you need to name your variable. The name should reflect the kind of data stored in the variable, so make it descriptive. In syntax, the name of a variable is its **identifier**.

After you define a variable with an **identifier** and [**data type**](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence/5-reference/06-type), you need to **initialise** it with a starting value.
Then, you can then read the current value and store new values in the variable as the program runs and the information the variable represents changes.

## In C++

:::tip[Syntax]
Variables can be created in C++ using the following syntax:

![The syntax for variable declarations in C++.](./images/variable-declaration.png "The syntax for variable declarations in C++")
<CommmonLink type="syntaxDiagramGuide"/>
:::

Variable declarations need to include the [type](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence/5-reference/06-type) of data you want to store. The name of the type is followed by the name (identifier) for the variable you want to create.
A variable can optionally be given a value when it is declared.
You can also declare multiple variables of the same type in the one line of code.

By convention, variables should use **snake_case** for their name. This is where the first letter is lowercase and each new word in the identifier is separated with an underscore character (`_`). For example, `bottle_volume`, `my_name`, and `this_is_a_long_name` are all in snake case.

## Examples

### Basic Example

In this program, we want to capture the user's name and greet them using it. We need a variable for the name, as it may change each time the program runs. Within the program, the variable will represent the name of the user.

```c++
#include "splashkit.h"

int main()
{
    // Create a variable called name
    // it can store a string
    string name;

    // Output the message
    write_line("Welcome to The Greeting");
    write_line();
    write_line("What is your name?");
    write("name: ");

    // Read user input and store it in the name variable
    name = read_line();

    write_line();
    write_line("Hello " + name);
}
```

### Example using multiple variables

The next example will help us calculate the area of a rectangle:

- Numbers for `width` and `height` which the user will enter.
- A string `user_input` to store the text the user enters before we convert it to a number.
- Number for `area` to store calculated values.

```c++
#include "splashkit.h"

int main()
{
    // Create variables width, height, user_input, and area
    double width, height;
    string user_input;
    double area;

    write_line("Rectangle Area");
    write_line();
    write_line("Enter the width and height of the rectangle");

    // read in width and convert to a double
    write("width: ");
    user_input = read_line();
    radius = to_double(user_input);

    // read in width and convert to a double
    write("height: ");
    // we can re-use user_input
    user_input = read_line();
    height = to_double(user_input);

    // calculate area
    area = width * height;

    write_line();
    write_line("Area " + to_string(area, 2) + " cm^2");
}
```

:::tip
Notice how the names of the variables help us understand how the program works. Also, adding in additional line breaks helps group the steps in our code to make it more readable.

### Circle Drawing Example

Let's use SplashKit to look how variables can be used in a graphical program. The following program captures a radius for a circle and uses that to draw to the screen. To achieve this we need two variables, `line` and `radius`. We use `read_line` to read a `string` from the user, and `to_double` to convert the text read into a `double` value. This value is stored in the `radius` variable, which can then be used in the call to `fill_radius`.

```c++
#include "splashkit.h"

int main()
{
    string line;
    int radius;
    double hue;

    write_line("Welcome to Circle Drawer!");
    write_line();
    write_line("Enter the radius of the circle to draw. (a whole number)");

    // Read value from the user and convert to double for radius
    write("Circle radius: ");
    line = read_line();
    radius = to_integer(line);

    // Read value from the user and convert to double for hue
    write_line("What color? Enter hue between 0 to 1");
    write("Hue: ");
    line = read_line();
    hue = to_double(line);

    // Draw scene and delay
    open_window("Circle Drawing", 800, 600);
    clear_screen(color_white());
    fill_circle(hsb_color(hue, 0.8, 0.8), 400, 300, radius);
    refresh_screen();
    delay(5000);
}
```

:::note[Summary]

- Variables are **constructs** you can create to store values in your programs.
- You can think of a variable as a box. The variable is the box, and its value is stored within it.
- Each variable and constant has a ...
  - **name** (identifier) that can be used to refer to it.
  - **type** that determines its size and how its value is interpreted.
  - **value** that it is storing.
- The first time you assign a value to a variable or constant, you are **initialising** it.
- You can **read** the value from variables in your instructions.
- A variable **is not** its value -- it is a container that stores a value, where its value can change over time as you write new values into the variable.
