A **constant** is similar to a [variable](/book/part-1-instructions/2-data/5-reference/10-variable), in that they have a name and a data type. Constants are declared within a program and must be given a value when they are created. However, they differ from a variable because once they are created, **the value within a constant cannot be changed**. This is useful for data that should not change during the program's execution.

## Constants -- Why, When, and How

*[Literals](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence/5-reference/14-literal) are values that are fixed within the code, so why do we need constants?*

With programming, the biggest challenge is making sure your code is **understandable**. Scattering your program with literal values becomes confusing very quickly. When you see a value like `10` in code it doesn't mean much, and could potentially represent anything. There will often be lots of these values that are easy to lose track of. Using a constant lets you name the value, which gives it meaning. When you see `MAX_ITEMS` in the code instead of `10`, you are reminded of its meaning.

Another advantage of using a constant is that you can change the value in one place. If you want to change the maximum number of items in your pack from 10 to 42, you change it in one place. Updating the value of the constant means that everywhere that reads it will get the new value.

## In C++

:::tip[Syntax]
The syntax for declaring a constant is very similar to declaring variables:

Variable and constant declarations use almost identical syntax in C++. The main difference between a variable and a constant is the `const` keyword at the start of the declaration. If you include `const`, you are creating constants. Without it, you are creating variables. A constant must also be given a value when created.

Just like variables, constant declarations also need to include the [type](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence/5-reference/15-type/) of data you want to store, and a name (identifier).
By convention, constants have an **UPPERCASE** name. Where the name has multiple words, separate them with underscores (`_`). For example: `MAX_ITEMS`.

## Example

This example will calculate and output the area of a few circles. It will use:

- A `PI` constant for the calculation.
- A number for `radius`.
- Numbers for `circumference` and `area` to store calculated values.

Constants are generally coded outside `main`, at the top of the file. This way they are accessible throughout the program. So we will code `PI` between the `#include` and the start of `main`.

```c++
#include "splashkit.h"

// Create a constant called PI
const double PI = 3.1415;

int main()
{
    // Create variables radius, circumference, and area
    double radius;
    double circumference, area;

    // Start with radius 5.25
    radius = 5.25;
    write("radius is ");
    write_line(radius);

    circumference = PI * radius;
    area = PI * radius * radius;

    write("Circumference:");
    write_line(circumference);

    write("Area:");
    write_line(area);
}
```

:::tip
By giving our constants names such as `PI`, we make our code easier to understand.

We can also use the same constant many times throughout our program, which is great. If we need to add more digits of precision to `PI`, or want to change the maximum number of items a player can have, we only have to change one thing!

## Activities

For each piece of information, identify whether it would make the most sense to store it in a variable or constant. Then, try writing the C++ code to declare that variable or constant. Remember that variables and constants both need an appropriate name and data type, and constants must also be initialised when declared.

1. The number of hours in a day.
2. The amount of water, in litres, left in your water bottle.
3. The name of the species of wildlife you have most recently seen.
4. The maximum number of tabs that can be opened at once.

  Same as with variables, there are other acceptable answers for the identifiers. Make sure to follow the C++ conventions, by using all upper case letters with words separated by underscores for constants (and snake_case for variables)
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1: </strong>Constant, because this value will not change. <code>const int HOURS_IN_DAY = 24;</code></li>
    <li><strong>2: </strong>Variable, because it will change if you drink from or fill up your bottle. <code>double water_left;</code></li>
    <li><strong>3: </strong>Variable, because it will change when you see something new. <code>string last_species_seen;</code></li>
    <li><strong>4: </strong>Constant, because the program only supports at most this specific value. <code>const int MAX_TABS = 500;</code></li>
  </ul>
</details>

:::note[Summary]

- Constants share many similarities with variables. Each constant has a ...
  - **name** (identifier) that can be used to refer to it.
  - **type** that determines its size and how its value is interpreted.
  - **value** that it is storing.
- However, you can only assign them a value once, when they are created. After this they cannot be changed.
- You can **read** the value from constants in your instructions.
- Generally we code constants *outside* `main`. This way they are accessible throughout your program.
