title: Library Offerings

Getting to know the libraries that you are using will be an ongoing activity. Now that we know about functions, you should be on the lookout for useful functions you can use to empower your programming.

We will stick with the SplashKit library, but the skills you are developing in reading and understanding the library will apply as you switch between langauges and libraries.

For now, we will look at functions that can help interacting with the user in the [terminal](/book/part-1-instructions/2-data/5-reference/51-terminal-functions) and how we can integrate [generative ai](/book/part-1-instructions/2-data/5-reference/52-gen-ai) into our code. There are also a whole range of user interaction functions that are useful for graphical programming, but we will wait until the next chapter to look at these as we need some additional tools to really make use of them.
