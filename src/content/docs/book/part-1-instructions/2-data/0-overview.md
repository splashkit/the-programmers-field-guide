So far our programs contain a sequence of instructions. These foundations are important, but our programs always do the same thing as there is no way of things changing in our program.

At the end of this trek, make sure you:

- Continue to focus on a sequence of actions, and building on what you learnt in earlier chapters.
- Can create programs that include:
  - Variables to store values that change.
  - Assignment statements to store values in variables.
  - Function calls to calculate values.

- Demonstrate how the different statements work, and interact with values in memory.
