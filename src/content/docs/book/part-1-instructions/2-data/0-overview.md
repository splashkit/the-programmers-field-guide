So far our programs contain a sequence of instructions. These foundations are important, but our programs always do the same thing as there is no way of things changing in our program.

At the end of this trek, make sure you can:

  - Continue to focus on a sequence of actions
  - Introduce variables to store values that change
  - Use assignment statements to store values in variables
  - Include function calls to calculate values

- Correctly use programming terminology to explain your code.
