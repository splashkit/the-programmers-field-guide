# Overview

Welcome to the challenge! Your task is to create a simple 4-pin push button binary calculator using SplashKit on your Raspberry Pi. In this project, you will read the state (HIGH or LOW) of four push buttons and then use those values to form a binary number. Finally, you'll convert that binary number into its decimal equivalent and display the result.

Remember: we are still learning about sequence and data—no loops or conditional logic yet! You'll record each reading by following a series of prompts.

# Hardware Setup

For this project, you'll need to build a simple circuit with push buttons:

- **Push Buttons:** Four buttons to represent the four binary digits.
- **Pull-Down Resistors:** Use a 10K Ω resistor for each button to ensure a default LOW state.
- **Breadboard and Jumper Wires:** For making your connections.
- **Raspberry Pi:** We'll use four GPIO pins (for example, Pin12, Pin13, Pin14, and Pin15) to read the button states. One side of each button connects to the 3.3V supply, and the other side connects to its respective GPIO pin. Each GPIO pin is also connected to ground through a 10K Ω resistor.

> **Safety Note:** Always double-check your wiring and ground yourself before handling components to avoid static discharge or accidental damage.

# Task Details

## 1. Initialization

- **Objective:** Initialize the GPIO system and configure your four button pins as inputs.
- **Hint:** Use SplashKit’s `RaspiInit()`, and set each pin mode using `RaspiSetMode()`.  
- **Example (for one pin):**
  ```csharp
  RaspiInit();
  Pins buttonPin = Pins.Pin12;
  RaspiSetMode(buttonPin, PinModes.GpioInput);
  ```

## 2. Reading the Button States

- **Objective:** For each of the four pins, prompt the user to press the button and then hit Enter. Record the pin's state (HIGH or LOW).
- **Process:** Do this one at a time (without loops). For example:
  - Prompt: "Press your button for the most significant bit, then hit Enter:"
  - Read the pin value and store it in a variable (e.g., `reading1`).
  - Repeat for the other three pins, storing them as `reading2`, `reading3`, and `reading4`.
- **Reference:** For push button reading logic, see [this guide](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence-and-data/0-panorama/8-read-value/).

## 3. Binary Addition Logic

- **Objective:** Convert the four readings (each 0 for LOW or 1 for HIGH) into a single decimal number.
- **Concept:** In binary, each digit has a weight. For a 4-digit binary number:
  - **Most Significant Bit (MSB):** weight 8 (2³)
  - Next bit: weight 4 (2²)
  - Next bit: weight 2 (2¹)
  - **Least Significant Bit (LSB):** weight 1 (2⁰)
- **Calculation:** Multiply each reading by its corresponding weight and add the results:
  ```txt
  decimalValue = (reading1 * 8) + (reading2 * 4) + (reading3 * 2) + (reading4 * 1)
  ```
- **Example:** If your button readings are 1, 0, 1, 1, then the binary number is 1011, which equals 11 in decimal.

## 4. Expected Outcome

Once you complete the program, it should:
1. Prompt you to press each button and record the four binary digits.
2. Calculate the decimal value from these four binary digits.
3. Display the result on the console.  
   For instance, if you press the buttons such that the readings are 1, 0, 1, and 1, the program should output:
   ```
   The decimal value is: 11
   ```

# Pseudocode Overview

Here’s a rough pseudocode outline to help you plan your solution:

```txt
// Initialization
Call RaspiInit()
Define buttonPin1 as Pins.Pin12 and set to GpioInput
Define buttonPin2 as Pins.Pin13 and set to GpioInput
Define buttonPin3 as Pins.Pin14 and set to GpioInput
Define buttonPin4 as Pins.Pin15 and set to GpioInput

// Reading Values (no loops; do each step in sequence)
Prompt: "Press your button for bit 1 (weight 8), then hit Enter:"
Read reading1 from buttonPin1

Prompt: "Press your button for bit 2 (weight 4), then hit Enter:"
Read reading2 from buttonPin2

Prompt: "Press your button for bit 3 (weight 2), then hit Enter:"
Read reading3 from buttonPin3

Prompt: "Press your button for bit 4 (weight 1), then hit Enter:"
Read reading4 from buttonPin4

// Calculation
Calculate decimalValue = (reading1 * 8) + (reading2 * 4) + (reading3 * 2) + (reading4 * 1)

// Output the result
Print "The decimal value is: " + decimalValue

// Cleanup
Call RaspiCleanup()
```

# Wrap Up

This task encourages you to think about how binary numbers work and how to convert them into decimal form using sequence and data. Work through the process step by step:
- Start by initializing your hardware.
- Read each button state individually.
- Use simple arithmetic to perform binary addition.
- Finally, display your result.

Good luck, and enjoy building your 4-pin push button binary calculator! Remember, take your time and build your solution gradually—step by step. Happy coding!
