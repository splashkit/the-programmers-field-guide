title: Airspeed Velocity

import { YouTube } from 'astro-embed';

On your journey, you encountered a strange person who mentioned something about coconuts and queries you vigorously about the airspeed velocity of unladen swallows.

To answer this age-old question, you can mock up the following program to calculate the airspeed velocity of these important birds. With a quick search, you find [an equation](http://www.style.org/strouhalflight) based on the Strouhal Number and some [details on swallows](http://style.org/unladenswallow/). We can use this information to create a program that can be used to calculate the airspeed velocity of African and European Swallows.

From these articles we can determine that the airspeed velocity of a swallow can be calculated using `Speed = Frequency * Amplitude / Strouhal`. Code this into a program and then calculate and display the airspeed for different wing values.

- We can use two set Strouhal values - An efficient Strouhal number of 0.20 and low efficiency Strouhal of 0.40.
- African Swallow: frequency 15hz, amplitude 21cm
- European Swallow: frequency 14hz, amplitude 22cm

## The Algorithm

My plan for this program involves the following steps:

1. Show the program details at the start
2. Read in the name, frequency, and amplitude
3. Calculate min and max speeds
4. Output results

When the program starts, we can output a few messages to let the user know what the program does. This can be a sequence of calls to `WriteLine` from `System.Console`.

Reading in the bird's name will be relatively straightforward, we can use `Write` to display a prompt asking the user to enter the bird name, and then use `ReadLine` to get the value we then store in the variable. With frequency and amplitude, we will require the extra step to convert this to a number. These will need to be `double` values, and any loss of precision will not cause issues. To do the conversion we can call `ToDouble` from C#'s `System.Convert`. The steps will be:

1. Show the prompt to the user (tell them what we want them to enter)
2. Read in their response as a string - they enter text
3. Convert the line entered to a double, and store in the variable

Calculating the min and max speeds can use the expression that we noted above, and we will need some variables into which we can store these results. These can then be used in the "output results" step, where we can call `WriteLine` to output the calculated details.

## The Building Blocks

Reviewing this plan, we can identify which constants and variables we will need to create within our program. We have a few set values, and some values that we want to be able to be different each time the program runs. We can create the following building blocks to help us work with this into our program:

- Two constants:
  - `STROUHAL_LOW_EFFICIENCY` to store 0.4
  - `STROUHAL_HIGH_EFFICIENCY` to store 0.2
- Six variables:
  - Two strings:
    - `birdName` to capture the name of the bird the user enters
    - A `line` to store the numbers they enter, until we can convert them to a double we can use.
  - Four double values:
    - `freq` to store the frequency of the birds wing stroke, in beats per second.
    - `amp` to store the amplitude in meters.
    - `resultMax` and `resultMin` to store the two speed calculations based on the low and high efficiency Strouhal values.

We will need to use `double` for these numeric values, and we will not have issues with limit of precision or accumulated rounding issues. We need the `line` to read the value, and read line returns us the text they entered.

## Pseudocode

```
Declare constants:
 - STROUHAL_LOW_EFFICIENCY = 0.4
 - STROUHAL_HIGH_EFFICIENCY = 0.2

Declare variables:
 - birdName, line to store string data
 - freq, amp to store double data

Display program details

Read in the name of the bird from the user

Read the frequency and amplitude - converting from string to double

Declare variables:
  - resultMax, resultMin to store double data

Calculate the airspeed, given the fixed Strouhal values
  resultMax = freq * amp / STROUHAL_HIGH_EFFICIENCY
  resultMin = freq * amp / STROUHAL_LOW_EFFICIENCY

Output the bird's name, and its min and max airspeed
```

## Building and Running

Build and run this in small steps:

- Get the initial output messages, reading the bird's name, and a start for the output. Build and run.
- Add reading in frequency, and add it to the output. Build and run.
- Duplicate the frequency code and change to read and output the amplitude. Build and run.
- Add the calculation for max speed, update output, then build and run.
- Test the values work as expected
- Duplicate for min speed, update output, then build and run.
- Test that it all works
- Celebrate!

## Wrap Up

Notice that the process for building this program was the same as the change calculator. Think about the algorithm, identify any things you need in the code (variables and constants), then code by building out the plan little by little.
