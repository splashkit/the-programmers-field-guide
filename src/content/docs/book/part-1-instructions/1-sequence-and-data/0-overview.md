Our first trek will explore the use of sequence and data, the foundations for all programming concepts to come.

At the end of this trek, make sure you can:

- Create small programs with:

  - A sequence of instructions that achieve something
  - Variables
  - Assignment statements
  - Method calls, with a range of arguments

- Correctly use programming terminology to explain your code.
