Classes are a tool for structuring code into entities that contain data and methods.

Each class definition is a blueprint that describes an entity in terms of what it **knows** (data) and what it can **do** (methods).

A class defines a **custom data type** we can use in our programs when building digital realities.

Classes have a **name**, and contain zero or more **members**.

* A class member can be a:
  * field - to store data.
  * constructor - to initialise objects when they are created.
  * method - to perform an action.
  * property - to give access to data.

Each class member can be **public** or **private**:

* **public** members can be accessed by any code that has an instance of the class.
* **private** members can only be accessed by other code in the same class.

**Fields** are just like variables, with a scope of the class in which they are declared.

**Methods** capture the actions that an object can perform. This is similar to functions and procedures in procedural programming.

**Constructors** are special methods which create and return an instance of the class in which they are declared.

  * A **default constructor** is a constructor with no parameters.

**Properties** allow us to write code to access data from within an object.

Classes can be used to create **objects**.

At runtime, objects perform the actions needed to produce the programs desired behaviour.
