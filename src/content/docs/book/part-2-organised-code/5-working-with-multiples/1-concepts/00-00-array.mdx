title: Array
---

An array is a special kind of **variable**, one that stores multiple values instead of a single value. The values within an array, called elements, all have the same [type](../../../../part-1-instructions/1-sequence-and-data/1-concepts/06-type).

:::note

- An array is a kind of variable that you can create in your code.
- Each array has a number of elements.
- Each element stores a value.
- The type of each element is the same as the other elements in the array.
- The elements of an array are accessed via an index.
- The first element has the index **0**, the second has the index **1**, etc.
- Individual elements of an array are much like a standard variable.
- You can store a value in an element of an array using an [assignment statement](../00-02-assign-element).
- You can use the value from an element of an array in an [expression](../00-03-expressions-with-arrays).
- The [for loop](../01-for-loop) works perfectly with an array, you can repeat an action *for each element of an array*.

## Arrays - Why, When, and How

Arrays are another tool that will greatly help you build bigger and more interesting programs. Once you get your head around how they work, you will be able to easily add arrays to your programs to make it easy to add lists of values wherever you need them. You can add arrays to fields of a struct, so you can have multiple values within that entity in your code. You can use arrays of structs to have lists of your entities. They can be local variables and passed as parameters. Anywhere you had data before, you can now start to use arrays.

You need to pair arrays with a loop to repeat actions you want performed to each element of the array. You can then have any number of elements in the array, and a simple loop repeats your instructions for all elements. It is a really simple and effective way to start to grow out what you can do.

One challenge we currently have is that our arrays will have a **fixed size**. We can work around this by having a maximum number of values that we want to allow within the array, and then have a variable to track the *current number* of elements that we increase and decrease as we add or remove elements.

## Arrays in Memory

Arrays store multiple values, with an index that provides access to the individual elements within the array. Conceptually this can be viewed as a [variable](../../../../part-1-instructions/1-sequence-and-data/1-concepts/07-variable) that contains multiple slots (the elements) into which the values are stored.

Many languages have **0** as the index of the first element. This reflects how the values are actually stored in memory. [Figure x.y](#FigureArrayContiguousMemory) shows how an array (named `arr` in this Figure) is stored in memory. The array is a **contiguous** area in memory, with the elements next to each other. You can think of the array as starting at the first element, so you need to skip *0* elements to access the first element. The second element is accessed by skipping *1* element, so it has index *1*. The third element is accessed by skipping *2* elements, so it has the index *2*, etc.

The size of each of the elements of the array can then be used to quickly locate it, given its index. If you have an array of `integer` values, then these are each 32 bits (4 bytes), so the element at index 3 is 3 × 32𝑏𝑖𝑡𝑠 (96 bits) past the start of the array.

The great thing is that you do not need to think about these details, but knowing this should help you remember that the first element of an array is at index 0.

:::note

- Arrays are allocated a contiguous area of memory, with the elements next to each other.
- The array index is used to determine how many elements (values) are skipped to access the element you require.
- The index of the first element of an array is **0**.
- The last index of the array is therefore **n - 1**, where *n* is the number of elements in the array

## Example

We can use arrays to further adjust some of the programs we have been working with so far. We can extend the Fly Catch game, so that the game has a number of flies. In the change calculator we can put our different coins into an array, further simplifying the process of calculating change. In each case, the array lets us easily store a number of values in a single variable.

Have you wondered why the parts and chapters in the Field Guide start with 0? Now you know 😁.
