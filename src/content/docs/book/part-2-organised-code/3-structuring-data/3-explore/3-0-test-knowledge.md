At this point in your journey, you have the tools to build more interesting programs by organising your code and your data. To test out your understanding, build one or more of the following programs.

- [Entity manager](/book/part-2-organised-code/3-structuring-data/3-explore/3-1-entity) - create a simple data entry system that allows you to see and edit details of a single record.
- [Explore game states](/book/part-2-organised-code/3-structuring-data/3-explore/3-2-game) - explore creating a game menu and other states.
