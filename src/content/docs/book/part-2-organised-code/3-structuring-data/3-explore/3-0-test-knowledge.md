title: Test Your Knowledge

At this point in your journey, you have the tools to build more interesting programs by organising your code and your data. To test out your understanding, build one or more of the following programs.

- [Entity manager](/book/part-2-organised-code/3-structuring-data/3-explore/3-1-entity) - create a simple data entry system that allows you to see and edit details of a single record.
- [Explore game states](/book/part-2-organised-code/3-structuring-data/3-explore/3-2-game) - explore creating a game menu and other states.

For this you want to show how to create and use structs and enums, while also continuing to show how to organise your code in functions and procedures. You want to see these new data types working in conjuncture with the other programming features you have already mastered.
