Now that we can allocate variable amounts of memory using `new []` and `malloc`, we can begin to explore dynamic memory management at a deeper level.

After covering the fundamentals, we'll resume working on our generic `bounded_array` class. We'll develop it into a `dynamic_array` that can expand as we add elements to it, while exploring the interactions between raw memory management and classes further.

We'll also see how language models (AI) can help us write these tricky classes, and learn to control them to generate the code we want.
