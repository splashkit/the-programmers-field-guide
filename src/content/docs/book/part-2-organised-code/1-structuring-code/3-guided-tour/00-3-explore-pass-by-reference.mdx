Finally, let's try building a small program that uses _pass by reference_. There are several cases when we want to use pass by reference, but a common one is when we want a procedure to change variables _outside of itself_.

## Swap
We'll see this in action by writing a `swap` function, which will take two integer variables as references (using `&`), and _swap_ their values. Without pass by reference this would be difficult, since we are modifying the variables that are passed in themselves.

Here's what the procedure will look like:

|   |   |
|---|---|
| **Procedure** | *Swap* |
| **Parameters** | `x`: A reference to the first integer to swap |
|                | `y`: A reference to the second integer to swap |
| **Description** | Takes two references, `x` and `y`, and swaps their _values_.|

### Write the Code and Test

Let's write the code for this now. Here is a program you can use to test it out:

```cpp
#include "splashkit.h"

// Add swap code here

int main()
{
  int num_a, num_b;

  num_a = 2;
  num_b = 8;

  // First print the numbers as-is
  write_line("Before the swap:");
  write_line("num_a is " + to_string(num_a));
  write_line("num_b is " + to_string(num_b));

  // Swap the values of the two variables
  swap(num_a, num_b);

  // Print the numbers afterwards - they should be swapped
  write_line("\nAfter the swap:");
  write_line("num_a is " + to_string(num_a));
  write_line("num_b is " + to_string(num_b));

  return 0;
}
```

```cpp
/**
 * Swaps the values of the two integer variables passed in.
 *
 * @param x The first integer variable to swap
 * @param y The second integer variable to swap
 */
void swap(int &x, int &y)
{
  int temp;

  // store the value from `x` in temp
  temp = x;

  // assign the value of `y` to the variable passed in as `x`
  x = y;

  // assign the values that was in `x`, to the variable passed in as `y`
  y = temp;
}
```

:::tip
When you run the program, you'll see how the values stored in `num_a` and `num_b` are swapped.

Try removing the ampersands (`&`) from `void swap(int &x, int &y)`, and see if this still happens. Why? Why not?
