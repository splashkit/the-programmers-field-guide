Functions are like procedures, but can return a value.
Just like procedures, they are really useful for organising our code.
Because they can return a value, they are particularly useful when we want to group a sequence of statements that calculate something.

Watch this video to:

- Get started writing functions.
- See how functions can be used to organise code.
- See how to use the return statement to return a value from a function.

When you have gone through this video you should be able to write simple functions of your own.
