Procedures enable us to separate our code into named groups of instructions.
This makes our code easier to read, and easier to reuse, and is critical to creating a well-designed program.

Watch this video to:

- Get started writing procedures.
- See how procedures can be used to organise code.
- See how a procedure can use local variables.

When you have gone through this video you should be able to write simple procedures of your own.
