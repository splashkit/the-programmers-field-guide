Exceptions are used when something unexpected and exceptional has happened in a program.
As programmers, we can *throw* exceptions when unexpected behaviour occurs, and *catch* exceptions to control what happens next.

Watch this video to:

- Get started using exceptions.
- See how the throw keyword is used to indicate exceptional behaviour has occurred.

After this video you should be able to throw and catch basic exceptions in your programs.
