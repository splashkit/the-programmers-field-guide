Organising code into functions and procedures is useful within a single program.
We can make our code even more powerful by creating reusable collections of functions and procedures that can be used in any program.

Watch this video to:

- Get started organising code into different files.
- See how to use a header file to enable access to functions and procedures.
- See how to compile multiple code files in a single terminal instruction.

After this video you should be able to procedures and functions in a single program across different files.
