A game in the Australian Football League consists of two teams aiming to achieve the highest score. The score calculated from the number of goals and behinds each team kicks. A goal is worth six (6) points, and a behind is worth one (1) point. You can read further on this in the [AFL explained scoring page](https://afl-explained.com.au/scoring/).

Build a program that allows the user to enter details of an AFL game, output scores and winners, and provide a menu for the user to update game details and output scores.

An example of this running is shown below:

Make sure you have at least the following functions and procedures:

- `draw_heading_line`: accepts a width parameter, and returns a string like `"+------------------------+"` (when width is 26).
- `draw_title`: accepts a title and width. Returns the title text in a box (with the heading line above and below). For example, the main menu title above would have the title as "Main Menu", and a width of 26.
- `read_string`, `read_integer`, `read_integer_range`, and `read_boolean` to read and validate input from the user.
