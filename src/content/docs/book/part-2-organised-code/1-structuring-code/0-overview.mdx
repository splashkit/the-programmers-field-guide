This part of the journey should really help make programming so much easier.
With a few new tools, we can start to break down our code into smaller sections, meaning we do not have to keep so much logic in our heads all at once.
This will help us write more complex programs.

At the end of this trek, make sure you:

- Continue to build on what you learnt in earlier chapters.
- Can explain the use of functions, procedures, and parameters in helping organise your code.
- Create functions and procedures to organise your code.
- Can use parameters to accept arguments from callers.
