## Test Your Knowledge

### Creating a Film and TV Show Database

In this project, you will need to develop a database for managing user's watched movies & TV shows, including; their favourites, ratings and reviews, genres, displaying lists by separate attributes, Actors, Directors.

Your program needs to:

- Display different functionality as different "screens"
- Handle user input with both characters and numbers
- Include Account, Actor, Movie, TV Show, Director structs
- Include browsing which user can specify specific attributes to browse for
  - These displays should include the option to sort by specific attributes

### Creating a Tile-Based RPG

In this project, you will need to develop a Tile-Based Role Playing Game (RPG) where the screen will be separated up into different square tiles in which the player can move between tiles. Tiles can be either traversable or non-traversable, and can have different effects on the Player Character if they enter that Tile. Non-Player Characters will spawn randomly throughout the world which the Player Character will be able to interact with in a way you choose. The game will include Quests which can include a variety of things, and the Player Character will have an inventory which stores items to be used with Quests.

Your program needs to:

- Draw the Tile-Based world where each tile will be represented by a differently coloured squares
- Spawn the character bitmap onto an appropriate starting tile
- Spawn a random number of NPCs throughout the world on appropriate tiles
- NPCs should randomly traverse tiles throughout the world at random intervals, only entering appropriate tiles
- Include a Quest System, which is randomly generated upon game start and upon finishing the previous quest
- Include items which spawn randomly throughout the world on appropriate tiles, these items are used for quests and can be collected by the player character
