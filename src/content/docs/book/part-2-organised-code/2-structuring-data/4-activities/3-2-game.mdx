Create a small program that explores different game states to allow you to switch between different logic for menus, or other screens within an interactive program.

Have three states in your game - representing different screens/interactions the user can engage in.

- State 1: **playing**
  - Clear the screen to white
  - Draw a circle to represent the player
  - Move the player to a new random position when the user hits the space bar
  - Change the current state to:
    - "showing details" - when the user presses 1
    - "showing menu" - when the user presses 2
- **showing details**:
  - Clear the screen to light blue
  - Draw the player circle in a lighter color
  - Draw a small black circle with a radius of 2 at the player location
  - Draw the location of the player on the screen (the x and y value - using [draw text](https://splashkit.io/api/graphics/#draw-text-no-font-no-size))
  - Change the current state to "playing" when the user presses space
- **showing menu**:
  - Clear the screen to light green
  - Change the current state to "playing" when the user presses space
  - Quit the game if the user presses q

Use an enumeration to represent the different game states: playing, showing details, or showing menu.

Have a game data struct with the current state (using your enum), the player's location (x and y), and a boolean to indicate if the game should quit.

Make sure to use functions and procedures to initialise the game data and draw the different game states. (See the hints at the end of this page for more details.)

Loop while quit has not been requested, and the game's quit is false.

:::tip[Hints:]

Make sure to show that you can use the structs and enums that you have created.

Here are some functions and procedures to create:

- A function to initialise all the game data - something like "new game".
- Procedures to draw the game, and different game states:
  - A procedure to draw the game in the "playing" game state.
  - A procedure to draw the game in the "show details" game state.
  - A procedure to draw the game in the "show menu" game state.
  - And a "draw game" procedure which can *switch* based on the current state and should call different draw procedures such as "draw playing", "draw menu", etc.
  - Procedures to update the game:
    - One for when in the "playing" state
    - One for when in the "show details" state
    - One for when in the "show menu" state
    - and an "update game" procedure that can *switch* based on the current state, and call the specific update procedure (the ones above).

:::note[Useful SplashKit functions and types:]

You could consider using the [`point_2d`](https://splashkit.io/api/types/#point-2d) struct from SplashKit to store the x and y location of the player. Then you can use functions like [Random Screen Point](https://splashkit.io/api/geometry/#random-screen-point) to position the player, and [Point To String](https://splashkit.io/api/geometry/#point-to-string) to draw text with the player's position.

The [SplashKit Colors](https://splashkit.io/guides/color/splashkit-colors/) page has a grid with all SplashKit's [Color](https://splashkit.io/api/color/) options in the "Color Palette" section.
