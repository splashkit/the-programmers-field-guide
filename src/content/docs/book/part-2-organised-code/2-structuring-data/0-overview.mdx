In [Structuring Code](/book/part-2-organised-code/1-structuring-code/0-overview.mdx), we saw how to organise our code into functions and procedures. This has allowed us to start building larger programs. However, we haven't yet seen the tools we can use to organise data.

Data is a key enabler in helping us build and communicate the things within our digital realities. By organising our data, we can start to capture the things that exist within our code far more clearly than we have with just primitive data line numbers and text.

This chapter will show you how to create your own data types, allowing you to model the entities (things) related to your program. This means that your code can work with more meaningful values, making it easier to see what the program is about and further simplifying how things work.

When you have understood the material in this chapter you will be able to define your own data types to model the entities you want to work with in your program.

:::tip
Modelling will be a key process in this chapter. You need to be able to picture the digital reality you are creating, and see *entities* (things) within it. You can then start to create these entities in your code.
