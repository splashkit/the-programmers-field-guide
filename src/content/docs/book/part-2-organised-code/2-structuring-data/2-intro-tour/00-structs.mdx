Structs empower us to create our own data types, which combine multiple fields into a single entity.
This helps us to represent the *things* within our program and more easily keep related data together.

Watch this video to:

- Get started with structs.
- See how a const reference can optimise passing data to functions and procedures without compromising data security.

When you have gone through this video you should be able to create and use structs in your programs.
