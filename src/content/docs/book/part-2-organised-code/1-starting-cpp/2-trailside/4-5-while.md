The while and do while loops are used in the same way in C/C++ as they are in C#.

:::note[Syntax]
Notice that the syntax for while and do while are the same in C/C++ as they are in C#.
As with C#, you can also use `continue` and `break` within loops to jump back to the condition or to exit the loop.

## Example

Here is the example SplashKit event loop from the [while loop](/book/part-1-instructions/3-control-flow/2-trailside/04-1-while-loop#event-loops---dynamic-graphical-programs) page.

```cpp
#include "splashkit.h"

int main()
{
    open_window("Circle Test", 400, 400);
    clear_screen(color_white());

    while ( !quit_requested())
    {
        fill_circle(random_color(), rnd(screen_width()), rnd(screen_height()), rnd(50));
        refresh_screen();

        process_events();
    }
}
```

Here is the C/C++ version of the [do while loop](/book/part-1-instructions/3-control-flow/2-trailside/04-2-do-while#how-does-do-while-work) example.

```cpp
#include "splashkit.h"

int main()
{
    string again;

    do
    {
        write_line("Hello");

        write("Again: ");
        again = read_line();
    } while (again == "y" || again == "Y");
}
```
