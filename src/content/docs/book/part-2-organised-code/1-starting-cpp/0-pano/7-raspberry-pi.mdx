# Overview

SplashKit makes it really easy to port your C# code to C++ on your Raspberry Pi. In fact, many SplashKit functions share the same names and similar usage in both languages! This guide will show you how straightforward it is to convert your C# code into C++—and we’ll point you to the official documentation for more details.

# What’s the Big Difference?

In C#, you might write code like this:

```csharp
using System;
using SplashKitSDK;
using static SplashKitSDK.SplashKit;

// Initialize
RaspiInit();
Pins buttonPin = Pins.Pin12;
RaspiSetMode(buttonPin, PinModes.GpioInput);

// Read a value
PinValues reading = RaspiRead(buttonPin);
WriteLine("Button reading: " + reading);
RaspiCleanup();
```

Converting this to C++ is almost as simple as a search-and-replace. In C++, the syntax changes a little, but the function names remain familiar:

```cpp
#include "splashkit.h"

int main()
{
    // Initialize
    RaspiInit();
    Pins buttonPin = Pins::Pin12;
    RaspiSetMode(buttonPin, PinModes::GpioInput);

    // Read a value
    PinValues reading = RaspiRead(buttonPin);
    write_line("Button reading: " + to_string((int)reading));

    RaspiCleanup();
    return 0;
}
```

# Key Points When Converting

- **Function Names:**  
  Most SplashKit functions are identical in C# and C++. For example, `RaspiInit()`, `RaspiSetMode()`, and `RaspiRead()` work the same way in both languages.
- **Syntax Differences:**  
  C++ uses `#include "splashkit.h"` instead of C#’s `using` statements. Also, note the use of the scope resolution operator (`::`) when referring to enums and constants.

- **Compilation Process:**  
  Unlike C#, where you use `dotnet run` to compile and execute your code in one step, with C++ you compile and then run your program separately. See our [Compiling C++ Programs](/book/part-2-organised-code/1-starting-cpp/0-pano/1-compile) guide for more details.

- **Project Structure:**  
  In C#, you have a project file that manages dependencies. With C++, you simply compile your `.cpp` file(s) directly using a compiler like **clang++** or **g++**.

# What to Do Next

1. **Review the Documentation:**  
   Visit the [SplashKit Raspberry Documentation](https://splashkit.io/api/raspberry) to see detailed information about the C++ API. You'll notice that the same functions you used in C# are available in C++ with very similar usage.

2. **Try Converting a Simple Program:**  
   Take one of your simple C# projects and convert it to C++. Start by changing the syntax and compile it using:

   ```bash
   clang++ your_program.cpp -l SplashKit -o your_program
   ```

   Then run it with:

   ```bash
   ./your_program
   ```

3. **Experiment:**  
   Experiment with both versions to see how minor syntax differences translate, and enjoy the newfound control and efficiency of C++.

# Wrap Up

Moving from C# to C++ with SplashKit on Raspberry Pi is simple because many function calls remain consistent across both languages. By reviewing the documentation and trying out a few small projects, you'll quickly gain confidence in writing C++ code. Happy coding and enjoy the power of C++ on your Raspberry Pi!
