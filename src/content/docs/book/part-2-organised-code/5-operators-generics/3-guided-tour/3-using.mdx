Now that we have the generic array we can start to use it within our projects. In this section we can have a look at moving the code into a header file so that it can be included in other projects easily, and we can then look at how we could have used this in our statistics calculator and our fly catch programs.

## Moving it to a header

In the [structuring code](/book/part-2-organised-code/1-structuring-code/0-overview) chapter we saw how to use [header files](/book/part-2-organised-code/1-structuring-code/5-reference/07-forward-declarations/#header-files) to share code we have created. The generic array is the perfect example of something that can be shared. If we put this in a header file, then we can include that header in our statistics calculator code and our fly catch code.

As this is C++ code, and it won't work in C, we can put this in a file with a **.hpp** extension. This helps indicate that it is C++.

With C++ templates, the compiler needs all the code when the template is used. It needs to be able to generate the code from the template for the different type options that we use. As a result, you will need to copy the declarations, and their implementations into the header file.

Remember to add the header guard, to ensure that we do not include this code more than once. Review the previous [header files](/book/part-2-organised-code/1-structuring-code/5-reference/07-forward-declarations/#header-files) page for the code to handle this.

If you cut and paste the code from the original test, then you can include your new header and make sure that things still work. Once the test runs, you know the header has everything that it needs.
