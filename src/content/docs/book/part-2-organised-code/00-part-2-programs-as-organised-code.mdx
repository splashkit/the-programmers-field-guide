Welcome to the Part 2 of this journey.

In Part 1 you have explored programs as instructions, and the structured programming principles of **sequence**, **selection**, and **repetition**.
At this point, the amount of code we are writing is starting to get to a size where it is too much to deal with. We need new tools to help us manage this complexity and to help us structure the data within our programs.

Part 2 focuses on programs as a way of organising our code. The tools we introduce here will help reduce the complexity of the code we need to write, and further empower you to break down code in manageable chunks.

At the end of this part you will be able to build larger and more complex programs, and have a good understanding of how these different tools let you manage code and organise data. This will prepare you well for moving to higher levels of abstraction in Part 3.
