The `Play Game` procedure will require some thought to design its logic.

[Table x.y](#TablePlayGameMethodSpecs) contains the specification for this procedure. It will be responsible for coordinating the actions of the game, while `Perform Guess` coordinates the actions for a *single* guess.

| **Name** | *Play Game* |
| **Description** | `Play Game` is responsible for coordinating the actions involved in playing a single game of *Guess that Number*. Initially the computer will generate a random target value, and output starting text. Then it will repeatedly ask the user to guess the number, until either the user has guessed the value or they have run out of guesses. If the user does run out of guesses then the computer ends the game, and tell the user the target value. |

The implementation of this procedure will require us to store some data. The following local variables will be needed to store data within this procedure:

- `My Number`: This will store the computer's randomly chosen number.
- `Guess Number`: This will store the current guess the user is at, allowing the computer to stop looping when the number of guesses exceeds 7.
- `Got It`: A Boolean value to indicate if the user did guess the number, allowing the computer to stop looping when the user guesses the number.

The flowchart for this is shown in [Figure x.y](#FigurePlayGameLogic), and again in [Figure x.y](#FigurePlayGameBlocks) with its blocks highlighted. This code uses a **loop** to ask the user to perform up to 7 guesses. The condition on this loop occurs *after* the loop body as the user must have at least one guess.

There is also a **selection** after the loop to output the answer if the user ran out of guesses. This is only done when the user has not guessed it themselves. This does not need to perform any other actions when the user did guess the number, so the False branch has no additional actions. In code this would be implemented with an if statement without an **else** branch.

:::note

- Notice how you can focus on the process for playing the game, without needing to worry about the details of performing a single guess.
- The condition of the if statement in `Play Game` check if the `Got It` is `false` using the not logical operator.

## Pseudocode for Play Game

[Listing x.y](#ListingPlayGamePseudoCode) contains the pseudocode for the `Play Game` procedure. This uses constants for `MAX_NUMBER` and `MAX_GUESSES`, this will make it easier to change the range of the numbers and the associated number of guesses if we choose at a later point. These also help make the code easier to read and understand.

```
Procedure: Play Game
-------------------------------
Constants:
  - MAX_GUESSES: an integer with value 7
  - MAX_NUMBER: an integer with value 100
Local Variables:
  - My Number, Guess Number (Integer)
  - Got It (Boolean)
Steps
  Assign My Number, a Random number between 1 and MAX_NUMBER
  Assign to Guess Number, the value 0
  Output 'I am thinking of a number between 1 and ', and MAX_NUMBER
  Repeat
       Increase Guess Number by 1
       Assign Got It, the result of PerformGuess(Guess Number, My Number)
  While Guess Number < MAX_GUESSES and not Got It
  If Not Got It then
       Output 'You ran out of guesses... the number was ', and My Number
```

:::note

- Isn't it nice to have already coded the logic for perform guess. Here you can then just focus on the steps to play the game.
- Notice the indentation make it easier to see which instructions are within the loop and branches of this code
- Breaking the logic into separate functions and procedures helps make your job easier!
