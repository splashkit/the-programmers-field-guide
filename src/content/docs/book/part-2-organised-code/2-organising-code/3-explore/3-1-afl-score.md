A game in the Australian Football League consists of two teams aiming to achieve the highest score. The score calculated from the number of goals and behinds each team kicks. A goal is worth six (6) points, and a behind is worth one (1) point. You can read further on this in the [AFL explained scoring page](https://afl-explained.com.au/scoring/).

Build a program that allows the user to enter details of an AFL game, output scores and winners, and provide a menu for the user to update game details and output scores.

An example of this running is shown below:

:::tip[Hints:]

Here are some functions and procedures you may want to consider adding:

- Functions to [read and validate data from the user](/book/part-2-organised-code/2-organising-code/1-tour/00-2-explore-functions) (strings, numbers, boolean).
- A procedure to output calculated details of each team (taking in the names and score details of the two teams).
- A procedure to print the menu (taking in the names of the two teams).
- A function to calculate a score from a number of goals and behinds.
- A function to calculate and return the name of the winner, from the two team names and scores.
