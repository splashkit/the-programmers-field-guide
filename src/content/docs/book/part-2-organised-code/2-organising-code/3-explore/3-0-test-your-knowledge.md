title: Test your knowledge
---

Having explore how we can organise code to help make the code in your programs easier to manage, now you need to test your understanding of what you have seen. Build one or more of these programs to demonstrate how to create and use functions and procedures:

- [AFL game data](/book/part-2-organised-code/2-organising-code/3-explore/3-1-afl-score) - create functions and procedures to calculate AFL scores and game details.
- [Click game](/book/part-2-organised-code/2-organising-code/3-explore/3-2-targets) - create functions and procedures for a small target hitting game.

Remember to focus on organising your code in appropriate functions and procedures, using parameters to share data as needed. Make sure your code isn't just all done in main.
