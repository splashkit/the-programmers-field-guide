The Fibonacci sequence is a common problem that can be solved with recursion (though a loop will be much more efficient). The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, then all subsequent terms are equal to the sum of the previous two terms. So the start of the sequence is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on. In designing a recursive Fibonacci function, we can pass in the position in the sequence, and then have it calculate and return the value at that position. Position 0 will have value 0, and position 1 will have value 1, all other values can be calculated based upon the values at the previous two positions.

Notice that the definition of the Fibonacci sequence is recursive.

|---|---|
| **Function** | *Fibonacci* |
| **Parameters** | `n`: The position in the sequence to get the value for. |
| **Returns** | `int`: The value of the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. |
| **Description** | Calculates and returns a value from the Fibonacci sequence. |

Have a go at building a recursive function to calculate a value from the Fibonacci sequence. Here is some starter code that you can use to build out this function:

```cpp
#include "splashkit.h"

/**
 * This function calculates the Fibonacci number at a given position.
 * 
 * @param n the position in the Fibonacci sequence
 * @return int the Fibonacci number at position n
 */
int fibonacci(int n)
{
    //TODO: implement this
    return 0;
}

int main()
{
  return 0;
}
```

### Add in base cases

Have a go at identifying the base cases, these should be relatively straightforward to identify from the description. Add these to the `fibonacci` function and test that this works for calculating these numbers in the sequence.

    header="Identified base cases"

We have two base cases based on the value of `position`: 0 and 1. In these cases we can just return the value of the position itself.

```cpp {9-12,19,20}
/**
 * This function calculates the Fibonacci number at a given position.
 * 
 * @param n the position in the Fibonacci sequence
 * @return int the Fibonacci number at position n
 */
int fibonacci(int n)
{
    if (n < 2)
    {
        return n;
    }
    //TODO: implement this
    return 0;
}

int main()
{
    write_line(fibonacci(0));
    write_line(fibonacci(1));

    return 0;
}
```

### Implementing the recursive case

Now add in the recursive code. Remember that this must move toward the base cases, and that you may need multiple recursive calls in this instance.

```cpp {13-16,21-24}
/**
 * This function calculates the Fibonacci number at a given position.
 * 
 * @param n the position in the Fibonacci sequence
 * @return int the Fibonacci number at position n
 */
int fibonacci(int n)
{
    if (n < 2)
    {
        return n;
    }
    else
    {
        return fibonacci(n - 2) + fibonacci(n - 1);
    }
}

int main()
{
    for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
        write_line(fibonacci(i));
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Testing your solution

Make sure to double-check the values you get from your solution. Check that this works for a range of values. What happens if we ask for a value at a negative position?

## Thinking about efficiency

The code for this is relatively simple, and matches the definition of the recursive Fibonacci sequence. But it is always good to think about the efficiency of this. Think through what happens when you ask for `fibonacci(4)`. How many times does it need to calculate `fibonacci(2)`? Now imagine how many steps are involved in calculating `fibonacci(6)`.

To see this inefficiency, add a `write_line` statement inside the start of your `fibonacci` function as shown below. Now just calculate `fibonacci(10)` and have a look at what you get out.

```cpp {3,13,19}
#include "splashkit.h"

using std::to_string;

/**
 * This function calculates the Fibonacci number at a given position.
 * 
 * @param n the position in the Fibonacci sequence
 * @return int the Fibonacci number at position n
 */
int fibonacci(int n)
{
    write_line("Calculating fibonacci " + to_string(n));
    //...
}

int main()
{
    write_line(fibonacci(6));

    return 0;
}
```

The version using a loop will be much more efficient. To implement this with a loop, you will need to keep track of the last two terms in separate variables. You may either have a separate next term variable, or reuse one of the existing variables. We leave this as an exercise for you to do yourself if you want.
