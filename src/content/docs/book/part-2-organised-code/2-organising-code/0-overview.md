This part of the journey should really help make programming so much easier. With a few new tools, we can start to break down our code into smaller sections, meaning we do not have to keep so much logic in our heads all at once.

If we think back to the change calculator, there was a lot of logic going on.
This made it difficult to focus on different, smaller parts, one at a time.
So, let's learn how to avoid that problem!

## Learning Goals

At the end of this chapter you will be able to:

- Explain the use of functions, procedures, and parameters in helping organise your code.
- Create functions and procedures.
- Use parameters to accept arguments from callers.
- Return results from function calls.
