With dynamic memory management, one of the tasks you can perform is to request space from the heap. With this request, the operating system will locate available space and allocate this to you for use in your code. The only thing the operating system really needs to know is how much space you require? It can then search for a free space of that size, allocate this to you, and then give you the address of (a pointer to) this newly allocated area of memory.

<div class="caption"><span class="caption-figure-nbr">Figure x.y: </span>When requesting a memory allocation you need to specify the size you want</div><br/>

:::note

Allocating memory is an **action** you can perform by calling appropriate Functions or Procedures offered to you by the Programming Language.

- Your request for memory must include an indicating of the amount of memory that you require. 
- You also need to have a pointer that will refer to the memory you are allocated.
- It is possible that your request will be denied, this occurs when the computer has run out of memory to allocate.

## Memory Allocation: Why, When, and How

If you want to load a value onto the heap, you use these memory allocation functions to allocate you space. Once you have the space allocated, you can access it via the pointer you receive back from the functions.

## In C/C++

C includes two memory allocation functions: `malloc`, and `calloc`. Let's see how each of these work.

|**Function** | **Required Arguments** | **Returns** | **Description** |
|-----------|------------------------|-------|---------|
| `malloc` | the `size` in bytes that you want. | a pointer (`void *`) | Allocates memory and returns a pointer to it. |
| `calloc` | the number of items, and the size of each item | a pointer (`void *`) | Allocates and clears memory, returning a pointer to the space allocated. |

These functions are used in combination with the `sizeof` operator. You can use `sizeof` to get the number of bytes that a data type or variable requires.

```
Operator: sizeof
Returns: (size_t) the number of bytes for a type
Parameter: a type or expression
```

### Allocate memory with malloc

The `malloc` function is declared within **stdlib.h**. It has the following function prototype.

```cpp
void *malloc(size_t size)
```

`malloc` is the standard memory allocation function in C. You tell it how much space you want, it allocates you that many bytes on the heap, and returns a pointer to that address.

The following example demonstrates the use of `malloc` to store an integer value on the heap. In this case we use `malloc` to allocate sufficient space to store an integer on the heap. The `sizeof` operator can give us the size of an integer, which we can then pass to `malloc` to ensure we ask for the right number of bytes. The result returned from `malloc` is a void pointer (an untyped pointer), so we need to cast this to be an `int` pointer (`int *`).

<a id="ListingMallocExample"></a>

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int *p;

    // get space for one integer from the heap
    p = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));

    // Access the data from the heap
    printf("The value on the heap is %d.\n", *p);
    
    // Assign the value 10 to the space on the heap
    *p = 10;

    // Access the data from the heap
    printf("The value on the heap is now %d.\n", *p);

    // free all sapce allocated
    free(p);
    p = nullptr;

    return 0;
}
```
<div class="caption"><span class="caption-figure-nbr">Listing x.y: </span>Example calls to <code>malloc</code></div>

:::note

- `malloc` is used for memory allocation.
- You need to include **stdlib.h** to use `malloc`.
- `malloc` allows you to allocate space on the heap. It returns a pointer to this space.
- `malloc` returns a `void` pointer (`void *`), you need to type cast this to the kind of pointer you want, for example `(int *)` casts it to an integer pointer.
- `malloc` returns `NULL` if it fails to allocate memory. This will occur if you run out of memory.

### Allocate memory with calloc

Like `malloc`, `calloc` is used to allocate space on the heap. The difference between `calloc` and `malloc` is that `calloc` clears the memory allocation. This will ensure that each byte in the space allocated is set to 0. Whereas, with `malloc` any previous values that happen to have been in memory will remain there giving the value a seemingly random value.

The other difference with `calloc` is that you pass it both a number, and a size. This allows you to allocate arrays easily with `calloc`, as it returns you a pointer to a block of memory that is `number x size` bytes.

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int *p;

    // get space for one integer from the heap
    p = (int *)calloc(1, sizeof(int));

    // Access the data from the heap - will always be 0 as it was cleared
    printf("The value on the heap is %d.\n", *p);
    
    // Assign the value 10 to the space on the heap
    *p = 10;

    // Access the data from the heap
    printf("The value on the heap is now %d.\n", *p);

    // free all sapce allocated
    free(p);
    p = nullptr;

    return 0;
}
```
<div class="caption"><span class="caption-figure-nbr">Listing x.y: </span>Example calls to <code>calloc</code></div>

:::note

- `calloc` is used for getting a *cleared memory allocation*.
- You need to include **stdlib.h** to use `calloc`.
- `calloc` performs a similar task to `malloc`, with the addition of clearing the space allocated.
- After calling `calloc` the memory you are allocated will have all of its bytes set to 0, whereas with `malloc` the memory retains whatever value was there previously.
- `calloc` returns `NULL` if it fails to allocate memory.
