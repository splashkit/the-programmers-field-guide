These activities require the use of inheritance, and aspects covered in the advanced tour.

Here are some options of programs you can build:

- [Dynamic Menu](/book/part-2-organised-code/4-member-functions/4-activities/4a-dynamic-menu): use objects to manage the user actions in a terminal application. The same ideas can apply to graphical applications, but here we test these in the terminal.
