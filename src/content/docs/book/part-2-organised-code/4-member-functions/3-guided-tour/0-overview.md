Member functions give you the ability to combine functionality and data within your structs/classes, with this giving rise to the term object to help us more easily talk about these entities within our programs.

Now that you have a basic understanding of member functions, let's have a go at putting these together to create some simple entities with both functionality and data.

In this section we will build a simple [account](/book/part-2-organised-code/4-member-functions/3-guided-tour/1-account) entity to model a bank account. In this, we will step through the mechanics of building this using a class. We will also write a re-usable array class, that we will continue expanding and making more useful through the next few chapters.
