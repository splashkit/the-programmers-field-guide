Now let's add a method to delete a single node from the list - with this our linked list starts to become fully usable.

The process of removing it involves re-routing the link from the previous node to the node that follows the node to be removed. This is shown in the following image.

![Illustration of the steps to remove a node](./images/list-delete.png)

We can easily find the next node via `next`, and the previous node using `list.find_previous_node` - we just need to connect those together and delete the middle node.

However, there are some different cases that need special attention, primarily removing the first node, removing the last node, and removing the only node.

Have a go at writing this out now, and test it out by deleting a few nodes.

:::tip
Add some code in `main` to iterate over the nodes in the linked list, and print out all the values. This will make testing a lot easier!

            // If it is the first node, then
            // previous_node is already the correct value.

            // Make its connection skip over `del_node`
            previous_node->next = del_node->next;
        }

        // Similarly, check for removing the last node
        if (last == del_node)
        {
            last = previous_node;
        }

        // Delete the node in memory
        delete del_node;
