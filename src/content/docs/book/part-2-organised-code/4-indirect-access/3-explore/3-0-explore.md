title: Test Your Knowledge

With indirect access you can start to include updates more easily in your programs. Build one or more of the following to explore how you can use pass by reference to update values in your programs structs.

- [Bank System](/book/part-2-organised-code/4-indirect-access/3-explore/3-1-database) - create a program to perform financial transactions.
- [Click game](/book/part-2-organised-code/4-indirect-access/3-explore/3-2-reaction-game) - create a small reaction timer game.

:::tip

Remember you want to use this activity to demonstrate how to build a program that utilises **pass-by-reference** for parameters. This should build on what you have learnt, organising your code in functions and procedures, using your custom data type (eg. structs), with pass by preference allowing the struct data declared in main to be updated within your procedures.

You should also test out what occurs if you remove the `&`, and demonstrate your understanding of why this occurs.
