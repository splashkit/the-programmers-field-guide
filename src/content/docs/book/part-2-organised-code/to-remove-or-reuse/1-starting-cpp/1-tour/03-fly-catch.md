title: Fly Catch
---

Now try to convert the most recent iteration of your [Fly Catch](/book/part-1-instructions/3-control-flow/3-guided-tour/3-00-fly-catch) game.
Again, the logic and functionality of the game should remain the same.

One difference in syntax is how you access the key codes in SplashKit between C# and C/C++.
For example, in C# you used `KeyCode.LeftKey`.
In C/C++, this becomes just `LEFT_KEY`.

With this information, try to write a C/C++ version of Fly Catch.
Use [our solution](/book/part-2-organised-code/to-remove-or-reuse/1-starting-cpp/4-camp/3-fly-catch) if you get stuck, but try to leave it as a last resort.
