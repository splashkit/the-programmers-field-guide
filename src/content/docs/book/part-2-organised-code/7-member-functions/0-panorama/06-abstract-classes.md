Inheritance and polymorphism open up some new opportunities for different ways to combine code within a program. As we saw with [polymorphism](/book/part-2-organised-code/7-member-functions/0-panorama/04-polymorphism), we have the ability to refer to objects of a child class anywhere we have a reference, or pointer, to the parent class. This can be a very useful feature, allowing you to interact with objects in a general manner without having to worry about the specifics of the kind of objects involved.

One limitation with this is that you can only access features that are coded into the parent class. These features may be overridden by child classes, but any new features added cannot be accessed as they are not present in the parent class (which is the reference being used). However, in some cases we may have base classes where we cannot implement features that we want to be able to access on all child classes. For example, in a drawing package we may have a `shape` class that acts as the base class for shapes that the user can draw on to the screen. We know that we want to draw the shapes, but we cannot implement this in the shape class. It is something we want to say that all shapes can do, but it is also something that can only be implemented in the specific child classes.

Abstract methods provide this capability. An abstract method is a placeholder declared in a base class that indicates all child classes must implement this method. You can think of this as a promise - the base class is saying "I promise that all objects will have this method - but I don't have an implementation of this here".

One implication of a class having an abstract method is that you can no longer create an object from this class. Instead, the class must be marked as *abstract*. Child classes that inherit from the abstract class must then provide an implementation for each abstract method, or they must be declared as abstract as well. In this way the language is able to guarantee that all objects will eventually have the required methods, even when called via a reference where the method is abstract (only a promise).

:::note

- In C++ `virtual ... = 0;` is used to mark a method as abstract, with the `= 0` indicating that there is no implementation of this method for this class. These are known as *pure virtual* methods in C++, but more generally as abstract methods.
- If a C++ class has one abstract/pure virtual method, then the class is abstract. There is no indication on the class that it is abstract, but you will not be able to create objects from this class.
- Child classes must override the abstract methods if you want to use them to create objects.
- References or pointers to the base class are still a useful way of referring to any object that inherits from this base class.

### Example

The following example illustrates the creation of an abstract `shape` class, and two derived classes `circle_shape` and `rectangle_shape`. Each shape has a fill color and can be drawn. We cannot implement the draw method in the shape class so it is marked as abstract. The circle and rectangle classes inherit from shape, and provide specific implementations of the draw method along with fields needed to capture the required data.

In `main` we can code an array of shapes and have these refer to objects created from the rectangle and circle classes. When we draw these, the object knows what it is, so the rectangles will draw using the rectangle code and the circles will use the circle code.

```cpp
#include "splashkit.h"

 *

        /**
         * @brief Virtual destructor to ensure proper clean up of derived classes.
         *
         * The destructor is called when objects of the class are deleted. Making
