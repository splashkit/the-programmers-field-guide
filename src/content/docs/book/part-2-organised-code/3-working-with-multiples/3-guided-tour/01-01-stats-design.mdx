Before we think about the calculations, let's put the infrastructure in place to get the numbers that we will work on within our program. We can quickly get a big picture for the program, and the data it will contain.

## Data Structure

As a first step, we should think about what data we need and how it will be represented in the program.

For this program we are going to need to handle an array of numbers. We will need to pass this around, and loop through all the elements. We _could_ use a C array, but as we covered in the intro tour, these arrays have frustrating limitations (such as not remembering their size).

We also have SplashKit's `fixed_array` and `dynamic_array`, which are closer to the arrays you'll find in other languages. In this case, we want the user to be able to enter a _variable_ amount of data, so it would make more sense to use a `dynamic_array`. This is what we will store our data in.

## Overview of Statistic Calculator's design

Before we start coding, it is a good idea to think through how the code will come together. This will ensure we have the right things in place before we start coding. This doesn't need to take long, you just want to get a bit of an idea of the direction you are going.

For this program, we will need to:

- Read the data in from the user
- Display the data entered
- Calculate the statistics: mean, maximum, and sum to start

We can break this down into a few functions and procedures:

- `main` will contain the data and coordinate things
- `populate_array` will read the data in from the user. This can use:
  - `read_integer` to get the number of values to enter
  - `read_double` to get the data from the user.
- `print` will display the data entered
- Three functions (`max`, `mean`, and `sum`) will calculate the statistics

We can represent this in a structure chart to start to visualise how this comes together.

Our `dynamic_array` struct would work in this context, as it can be passed around to the different functions and procedures. To avoid copies, we can pass it around our program using [pass by reference](http://192.168.1.101:3001/book/part-2-organised-code/1-structuring-code/5-reference/03c-pass-by-ref/).
