With arrays, you now have the main tools needed to start building larger programs. Build one or more of the following programs to demonstrate how you can use arrays to manage data within your program.

- [Music player](/book/part-2-organised-code/3-working-with-multiples/4-activities/3-2-music-player) - create the code for a iPod like music player.
- [Rock dodge](/book/part-2-organised-code/3-working-with-multiples/4-activities/3-3-game) - create a small game where the player dodges falling obstacles.

:::caution

All of these programs use a mix of arrays and structs, if you don't yet feel confident mixing structs and arrays, you should make sure to walk through the guided tours.
