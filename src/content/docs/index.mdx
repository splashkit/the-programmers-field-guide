		The programmer's field guide is your companion as you embark on your journey to understand the world of programming. Rather than a traditional textbook that focuses on the syntax of the latest and greatest programming language, this guide will help you develop your own mental model of programming that you can apply to any language.
	</Card>
	<Card class="home-card" title="Become an effective programmer" icon="puzzle">
		Not only will you learn how to write code, but you will also learn how to think like a programmer. You will learn how to break down problems into smaller pieces, how to think about the data you are working with, and how to use the tools available to you to solve problems. This guide is designed by a mix of academics and software engineers with industry experience.
